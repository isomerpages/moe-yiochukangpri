<p style="text-align:center;">I love PAL lessons because they are fun. For one lesson, we got to go to the music room and watch a video about a girl who went through some bad times. We also took part in music activities and went to the school garden to listen to the sounds of nature. It was relaxing to listen to birds chirping.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy PAL (Programme for Active Learning) because we get to do a lot of activities like running around, playing sports and games and learning outdoors. I learn how to notice other people’s feelings through the activities that we do.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy using my iPad for lessons as my teachers create fun activities for us. My favourite activity is Time to Climb on Nearpod because I get to challenge my friends and it is a fun way to revise what I had learnt. It is also easier to do group activities with my friends using my iPad. We get to create mind-maps and word clouds, and I like that because we can see what everyone’s responses.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">During my P2 PAL lessons, I created a robot with my group mates. We had to win games in order to earn fake money, which we could then use to buy items to build a robot. My group bought many toilet paper rolls to build our robot. I had a lot of fun because I liked working together with my classmates and we learnt how to work together well and not fight with one another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy being an Eco Monitor because I get to encourage friends to recycle and to do so correctly, such as putting the recyclables into the correct bins. I also like designing posters to spread the recycling message and to promote recycling efforts. When we first started as Eco Monitors, we attended a training course where the teachers taught us how to become confident leaders. I feel that being an Eco Monitor is an important role because I lead by example and guide my schoolmates to be more environmentally responsible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I like to dance at home, so I decided to join the Malay Dance CCA. I will sometimes even sing along as I dance! I get along very well with the other Malay Dance members, and we always have a good time talking and practising our routines during CCA sessions. One thing I am proud of is our preparation for this year’s Hari Raya virtual concert. Due to Covid-19 safe management measures, we could not perform “live”. However, my friends and I managed to celebrate Hari Raya with the whole school through a recorded performance. It was very fun and we even got to choose our own costumes! I would definitely recommend my juniors to join the Malay Dance CCA as they will create great memories!</p>
