**Q: What curricular activities did you participate in and what did you learn from those experiences?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Amy: My CCA was Football (Girls). I once participated in National School Games (NSG), and I would say it was not easy because we were facing many strong opponents. However, my whole team really learned about teamwork, and we tried to work together to score by passing the ball to each other without being selfish. My fondest memory would be the match against Westwood Primary School. My teammates and I were really serious about preparing for and winning the match. We worked hard to maintain our strong defence, thus preventing the opponents from crossing the midfield. Our team was also very determined to break through their defence line to score goals. Thus, we were very happy when we reaped the rewards with a score of six to zero.</p>
	
**Q: What values did you learn from YCKPS, and how have those values supported your learning in your personal life?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Amy: From YCKPS, I have learned the values of resilience. There had been a few times when I was faced with some challenges, such as difficult matches during NSG. However, I encouraged myself to push past my limits and to do more than what I thought I could, especially for the match against Haig Girls’ School which has a reputation for being one of the top ten schools for football. We were losing three to one at first, and it seemed like there was no chance of a victory for us. However, we still encouraged each other to press on. Hence, we were able to score one more goal. Although we didn't win, I felt that the match was a valuable experience.</p>

**Q: Share a memorable experience or event that took place during your time in the school**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yun Zhe: It was Chinese lesson. I had a very funny Chinese teacher who taught us in a fun way. For something that was hard for us to remember, she would use meme or something relatable to us to teach us, making it easy for us to remember and memorise. She also prepared a lot of notes for us especially for composition.</p>
	
**Q: What values did you learn from YCKPS, and how have those values supported your learning in your personal life?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yun Zhe: I would say it is responsibility. Especially now in Secondary school, I have to be independent in keeping track of my examinations, small tests and group projects without teachers’ reminder. It has taught me to be responsible and manage my own time well.</p>
	
**Q: Looking back, what advice would you give to the current students studying in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yun Zhe: Set up a personal timetable. Do not leave your work to the last minute and prioritise important work to do first.</p>

**Q: Share a memorable experience or event that took place during your time in the school**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Jeeva: There was one Mathematics competition that was held last year, called the Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC). I took part in it and I got a distinction. I found it quite memorable because I think that was one of the first times in YCKPS that I went on stage since I joined the school only in P4. Up till then, I did not go up on stage to collect something and it was because of Math, I could do so. I felt very happy about it.</p>
	
**Q: What curricular activities did you participate in and what did you learn from those experiences?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Jeeva: My CCA was Indian Dance. I used to learn dance before P1 as I had an interest in dancing from a very young age. When we moved house, where we lived was quite far from the place that we usually go for dance classes, so I could not attend it. As such, I joined the Indian Dance CCA in school, and thought that it would help develop my interest further. Unfortunately, because of COVID, I could not take part in SYF but I still had fun in Indian Dance because I was able to continue and develop my love for dancing.</p>
	
**Q: Looking back, what advice would you give to the current students studying in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Jeeva: I would say to never give up and to believe in yourself. Certain subjects may be difficult and challenging, and that may cause us to feel that we won’t be able to do well. As long as we believe in ourselves and put in our best efforts, even the impossible can be possible!</p>

**Q: What was your favourite subject in YCKPS, and why did you enjoy it?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yan Hoi: My favourite was Mathematics because I thought the Mathematics topics we were learning were interesting. I think it was also due to my teacher, Mr Chan. He made the lessons quite interesting. For example, he would frequently ask us to participate in a few activities before starting a new topic. At the end, he would explain to us what the topic and concepts were about. I really enjoyed the idea of using activities to introduce each topic. </p>
	
**Q: How did your teachers and classmates support you during your time in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yan Hoi: The teachers were very supportive. If I encountered any obstacles or negative incidents in school, they would alert my parents and ask them to check on me. I appreciated that because they went out of their way to make sure I was feeling fine. As for my classmates, they were very helpful. When I asked them for help in my homework, or if I had a question, they would very gladly help me. In short, my teachers and classmates rendered a lot of support to me in both academically and emotionally.</p>

**Q: In what ways did the school prepare you for your success/secondary school?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The school had invited a few secondary schools in the vicinity to give talks in our school. They also invited some of the students there to share about their experiences in their respective schools, so all of us could have a rough idea of what to expect in secondary school. Post-PSLE, they also organised some talks about how to choose our secondary schools. After we collected our results, there was also a speech from Mr Ng, our principal. He emphasised how PSLE is not the sole determinant of who we are in the future, so that was encouraging for all of us.</p>

**Q: What was your favourite subject in YCKPS, and why did you enjoy it?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hiu Fung: My favorite subject was Science because my Science teacher, Mrs Yean, was very caring and she always looked out for us. She was a very special teacher because she would go the extra mile for all her students. For example, once I did quite badly for exam and she believed that I could do better. So, she asked me to take a retest to prove that I had the ability to answer those questions. I also like Science because it is very interesting, it allows me to explore more about the world and about how things work around us. I enjoyed doing all the experiments as well.</p>

**Q: Share a memorable experience or event that took place during your time in the school**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hiu Fung: My most memorable event was the P5 camp. Even though it was raining a lot on the first day, I still enjoyed the various activities planned out for us. Some activities were walking on a low tight rope, longkang fishing and pitching a tent. I recalled we even had to stay in the tent for an hour.</p>

**Q: What values did you learn from YCKPS, and how have those values supported your learning in your personal life?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hiu Fung: I think resilience is the value that impacted me the most because throughout my primary school journey, I have faced a lot of difficulties, like preparing for PSLE. Through resilience, I learned to keep on trying and never give up. This contributed to my success today and where I am today.</p>

**Q: Share a memorable experience or event that took place during your time in the school**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Iryssa: The graduation event was a memorable experience for me because it was the last day of school, and the last time I got to meet my classmates and friends. During the event, every class put up an item to celebrate this milestone. My class decided to put up a dance item. Even though it was a celebratory event, there was a little bit of sadness knowing that we will head our separate ways. I am glad to still be in contact with some of my classmates who have played a big part in my primary school journey.</p>

**Q: How did your teachers and classmates support you during your time in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Iryssa: My teachers and classmates encouraged me and told me not to give up. They kept reminding me to study and revise because I failed PSLE once and this was my second attempt. They did not give up on me. I just told myself not to give up and try harder. Every day after school, I revised what the teachers taught me and what I had learnt in class.</p>
	
**Q: What values did you learn from YCKPS, and how have those values supported your learning in your personal life?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Iryssa: The value that really supported me is resilience. To me, resilience means to not give up easily. Even today, I always tell myself not to give up easily. Sometimes I felt like I wanted to give up because I was scared that I would fail my PSLE again. However, I just kept revising every day, and I told my mum to sign me up for tuition, so she signed me up for it. In the end, I managed to do well for my PSLE because I did not give up and the people around me also did not give up on me</p>

**Q: Share a memorable experience or event that took place during your time in the school**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yi En: A lot of experiences were memorable. My classmates and I always made things fun! If I were to only state one experience, it would be the P5 camp because we were together for about three days and there were just so many activities. I remembered it was very interesting because we had to work together and we also had to pitch a tent. We got to try our hand at many new games and activities and bonded as a class.</p>

**Q: How did your teachers and classmates support you during your time in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yi En: Our teachers were really very nice and would ask us how we were doing at least once a week. Sometimes, during our Form Teacher Guidance Period, our form teachers would ask us about what we had done during the holidays or over the weekend, and they tried to guide us in living a more balanced life. As for my friends, they were always there and we really helped each other out a lot, especially during the P5 and P6 years because it was more stressful and the curriculum was more intense. We supported each other by advising each other about homework and sharing revision tips.</p>

**Q: What values did you learn from YCKPS, and how have those values supported your learning in your personal life?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yi En: I would say the value of excellence, because every level has a value to focus on for the year. During my P6 year, the value of excellence had the most impact on me. During P6, there was a lot of focus about doing our best and trying to get the best scores in the exam, but our teachers constantly reminded us that excellence is not always about being the best; it is about us trying our best. And I think that's something that really impacted my life.</p>

**Q: Looking back, what advice would you give to the current students studying in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Yi En: I think one piece of advice I would give is to not dwell on or fixate on the negative. There's a difference between being prepared and overpreparing and burning out. As long as we're prepared, we should just go in there and do our best.</p>

**Q: What was your favourite subject in YCKPS, and why did you enjoy it?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Xinyi: Mother Tongue was my favourite subject in YCKPS. I would say it was my Mother Tongue teacher who made the subject enjoyable because she is a very humorous and encouraging teacher. She often engaged us in a lot of group work and this made the lessons more lively. She also had an organized way of helping us with revision and this took a huge load off my shoulders.</p>

**Q: What curricular activities did you participate in and what did you learn from those experiences?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Xinyi: My CCA was Volleyball, where I learnt the value of resilience. Our training sessions were really tiring and it was very hard to look up at the ceiling all day. Can you imagine being in that position for one and a half hours? Through playing Volleyball, I learned to persevere and not give up when the going gets tough. I’m now in a different CCA as my current school does not offer Volleyball and I really miss Volleyball.</p>

**Q: Looking back, what advice would you give to the current students studying in YCKPS?**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Xinyi: My advice is simple. Just put away all the distractions and focus on whatever you are doing. This will increase the efficiency of your revision and you can always go back to your phones or other temptations later.</p>
