Just as every student is different in their strengths and pace of learning, the school aims to help every student grow and become the best versions of themselves, imbuing in them the School Values of Care, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Resilience and Excellence. Armed with these values, Mr Ng believes every student should do well. He hopes that every student in YCKPS will grow to be Youths of Character who are Keen to Serve.

When prompted about his favourite place in the school, Mr Ng said it is the school garden. He enjoys the greenery and listening to the sounds of nature â€“ the moving water in the pond and the birds chirping. At times, he can see butterflies flitting around the flowers, the birds flying around and occasionally even a little lizard scurrying amongst the plants. Mr Ng explains that we can learn much from nature, even in the smallest and simplest things.

Indeed, there is much that we can learn from the things around us. Learning may begin in school, but it certainly does not end there. Our dedicated teachers not only teach us subjects, but they also teach us about life and the importance of values. They point us in the right direction and set us on course to go through the rest of our lives in primary school and beyond. Even after graduation, what our teachers have taught us will forever be etched in our minds and will guide us to become better people with each passing day.
