<p><strong>Presenting the 2025 Yearbook</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>We are truly delighted to share our school’s 2025 e-Yearbook with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year is especially meaningful as we commemorate YCKPS’s 75th Anniversary,
a milestone made possible by the collective spirit, resilience and support
of our school community. Within its pages are the treasured moments, milestones,
and joyful experiences your children have shared this year—memories made
even more special as we celebrate our 75th anniversary.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy of our students and their families, the yearbook
is password-protected. We kindly ask for your partnership in keeping the
password confidential, so these treasured memories can be enjoyed safely.</p>
<p>May every page bring back warmth, pride, and the joy of celebrating this
special diamond jubilee year.</p>
<p></p>
