<p>In Yio Chu Kang Primary School, learning mathematics is an active process
where students engage in meaningful activities and learning experiences
to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. Through activity-based
and inquiry-based learning, our teachers provide opportunities for students
to apply what they have learnt, articulate their thinking and mathematical
reasoning, hence allowing them to construct understandings of abstract
mathematical concepts.</p>

<p><strong>Critical thinking in Problem Solving</strong>
<br>The Polya’s 4 Steps (Understand, Plan, Do, Check) Approach is used to
help students develop the habit of thinking to solve mathematics problems
in a systematic manner. As students progress to a higher level, they are
introduced to more strategies to help them handle more demanding problems.</p>

<p><strong>Math Trails</strong>
<br>Students learn best when they can apply their learning to everyday situations.
The Mathematics Department organises Math Trails around the school for
our students to experience mathematics in real-life. &nbsp;Students will
get to solve authentic tasks at various parts of our school by applying
the mathematics concepts and skills that they have learnt. In this way,
our students will be able to see the applicability of the mathematical
knowledge they have acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Math Xcite!</strong>
<br>Under the Math Xcite! programme, the Mathematics Department organises
mathematics-related games and puzzles for all students. These activities
aim to spark curiosity and allow students to experience the joy and excitement
of learning mathematics in a fun and engaging way. In 2023 and 2024, the
department introduced a Rubik’s Cube Challenge to bring the iconic puzzle
closer to our students. The event generated much enthusiasm, with many
students actively participating and expressing a keen interest in improving
their solving skills. Beyond individual engagement, the Challenge also
fostered a spirit of collaboration and mentorship — our Primary 6 students
stepped up to guide their younger schoolmates in Primary 1 and 2, patiently
teaching them the basics of solving the Rubik’s Cube. Through the Challenge,
students not only explored the history and global competitive landscape
of the Rubik’s Cube, but also experienced the joy of learning through play
and peer interaction.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment – E2K Mathematics</strong>
<br>For students who demonstrate aptitude and interest in Mathematics, our
school offers the E2K Mathematics Enrichment Programme. This programme
is designed to stretch students beyond the standard curriculum by engaging
them in rich and challenging mathematical tasks. Grounded in an inquiry-based
approach, E2K encourages students to explore, investigate, and reason through
mathematical problems. Through guided discovery and collaborative discussions,
students learn to make conjectures, test their ideas, and refine their
thinking. This approach not only deepens their conceptual understanding,
but also nurtures important 21st-century competencies such as critical
thinking, perseverance, and communication.</p>
