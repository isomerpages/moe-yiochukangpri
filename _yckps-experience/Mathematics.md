<p>In Yio Chu Kang Primary School, learning mathematics is an active process
where students engage in meaningful activities and learning experiences
to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. Through activity-based
and inquiry-based learning, our teachers provide opportunities for students
to apply what they have learnt, articulate their thinking and mathematical
reasoning, hence allowing them to construct understandings of abstract
mathematical concepts.</p>

<p><strong>Critical thinking in Problem Solving</strong>
<br>The Polya’s 4 Steps (Understand, Plan, Do, Check) Approach is used to
help students develop the habit of thinking to solve mathematics problems
in a systematic manner. As students progress to a higher level, they are
introduced to more strategies to help them handle more demanding problems.</p>

<p><strong>Math Trails</strong>
<br>Students learn best when they can apply their learning to everyday situations.
The Mathematics Department organises Math Trails around the school for
our students to experience mathematics in real-life. &nbsp;Students will
get to solve authentic tasks at various parts of our school by applying
the mathematics concepts and skills that they have learnt. In this way,
our students will be able to see the applicability of the mathematical
knowledge they have acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Math Xcite!</strong>
<br>Under the Math Xcite! programme, the Mathematics Department also organises
mathematics-related games and puzzles every term for all students to participate.
These activities allow our students to experience the joy and fun of learning
mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment – Mathematics Olympiad and E2K Mathematics</strong>
<br>For students who demonstrated aptitude and interest for mathematics, our
school organises Olympiad training workshops and E2K Mathematics Enrichment
lessons to equip these students with concepts and skills that are beyond
the confines of the syllabus. Students would have the opportunity to hone
their problem-solving skills, as well as develop confidence and independence
in carrying out mathematical inquiry.</p>
