In Yio Chu Kang Primary School, learning mathematics is an active process where students engage in meaningful activities and learning experiences to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. Through activity-based and inquiry-based learning, our teachers provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learnt, articulate their thinking and mathematical reasoning, hence allowing them to construct understandings of abstract mathematical concepts.
  

**Critical thinking in Problem Solving**

The Polya’s 4 Steps (Understand, Plan, Do, Check) Approach is used to help students develop the habit of thinking to solve mathematics problems in a systematic manner. As students progress to a higher level, they are introduced to more strategies to help them handle more demanding problems.

**Math Trails**

Students learn best when they can apply their learning to everyday situations. The Mathematics Department organises Math Trails around the school for our students to experience mathematics in real-life.  Students will get to solve authentic tasks at various parts of our school by applying the mathematics concepts and skills that they have learnt. In this way, our students will be able to see the applicability of the mathematical knowledge they have acquired.

**Math Xcite!**

Under the Math Xcite! programme, the Mathematics Department also organises mathematics-related games and puzzles every term for all students to participate. These activities allow our students to experience the joy and fun of learning mathematics.

**Enrichment – Mathematics Olympiad and E2K Mathematics**

For students who demonstrated aptitude and interest for mathematics, our school organises Olympiad training workshops and E2K Mathematics Enrichment lessons to equip these students with concepts and skills that are beyond the confines of the syllabus. Students would have the opportunity to hone their problem-solving skills, as well as develop confidence and independence in carrying out mathematical inquiry.

**Mathematics Competitions**

To further stretch students who demonstrated aptitude for the subject, the Mathematics Department sends selected students to participate in various mathematics competitions.

* Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics Word Contest (RIPMWC)
* National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)
* Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO)
