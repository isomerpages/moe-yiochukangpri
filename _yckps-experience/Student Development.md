<p>The Student Development Team comprises of members from the Case Management
Team, Student Management Committee and Character and Citizenship Education
Committee. The Year Heads, Assistant Year Head, Special Educational Needs
Officers, School Counsellors and other committee teachers work closely
together to develop our students holistically and to ensure their well-being.</p>
<p>One of our key learning experiences is the Start It Right Programme which
is conducted at the start of each academic year. We aim to start the year
right by equipping students with the essential knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes to set goals and expectations, and to tackle challenges of
the new year. We also facilitate interactions among teachers and students
through this learning experience to foster positive teacher-student relationships
and build a caring and enabling school environment.</p>

<p><strong><u>Traffic Games</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, our Primary 4 students will participate in the Traffic Games
at the Road Safety Community Park. Our students reinforced their learning
on road safety awareness through the various hands-on activities, where
they will take on roles such as pedestrians, cyclists or motorists, applying
what they have learnt about navigating roads safely. This experience not
only deepened their understanding of traffic rules but also instilled a
sense of responsibility in making Singaporeâ€™s roads safer for everyone.</p>
