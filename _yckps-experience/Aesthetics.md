<h2>Building a Vibrant Arts Culture in YCKPS</h2>
<p>The Aesthetics Department strives to build a vibrant arts culture in the
school by providing personal, meaningful and impactful experiences for
all our students. Through the Aesthetics programmes, including our Art
and Music Instructional Programme and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP),
we aim for our students to:</p>
<p>• Enjoy and be inspired by the Arts</p>
<p>• Engage in the Arts with both head and heart</p>
<p>• Express themselves confidently through the Arts</p>
<p>• Be exposed to the local Arts scene</p>
