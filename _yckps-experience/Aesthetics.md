<p>The Aesthetics Department strives to build a vibrant arts culture in the

and Music Instructional Programme and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP),
we aim for our students to:</p>
<p>• Enjoy and be inspired by the Arts</p>
<p>• Engage in the Arts with both head and heart</p>
<p>• Express themselves confidently through the Arts</p>
<p>• Be exposed to the local Arts scene</p>

skills, thinking skills, art appreciation and learning of values. Students
experience different Art mediums and playing of different musical instruments,

<p>Our Music lessons provide a holistic and meaningful music education for
our students, guiding them to explore the musical elements in an engaging
and supportive setting. Through hands-on engagement and varied experiences,
our young musicians develop a deep appreciation and lifelong love for music.
