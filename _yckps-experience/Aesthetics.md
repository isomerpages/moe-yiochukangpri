## Developing appreciation for the Arts

Developing appreciation for the Arts
The Aesthetics Department strives to build a vibrant arts culture in the school by providing personal, meaningful and impactful experiences for all our students. Through the Aesthetics programmes, we aim for our students to:
-	Enjoy and be inspired by the Arts
-	Engage in the Arts with both head and heart
-	Express themselves confidently through the Arts
-	Be exposed to the local Arts scene
