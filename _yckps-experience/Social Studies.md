<p>Our school’s Social Studies team endeavours to shape our students into
becoming ‘Informed, Concerned and Participative’ citizens. Social Studies
prepares students for interacting with people of all cultures and communities
and teaches them the relevance of history to current events in the 21st
century. Guided by this objective, our team collaborates closely with subject
specialists from MOE’s CPDD unit. As part of our professional development,
our Social Studies teachers work to incorporate experiential learning into
the subject by planning performance tasks and learning journeys. Through
the learning of Social Studies, our students learn how to analyse information
through a critical lens and gain the confidence and skills to conduct their
own research.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 students took on the role of Sustainable Food Ambassadors
in a hands-on performance task that encouraged them to think critically
about food sustainability and healthy eating. With rising concerns about
processed food consumption among their peers, students were challenged
to improve the school canteen’s menu by promoting fresh, home-grown ingredients.
Through group-based inquiry, they interviewed classmates to understand
eating habits, researched methods for growing edible plants in the classroom,
and successfully grew their own crops. By incorporating their harvest into
simple recipes and presenting their findings to the school community, students
learnt how Singapore adapts to overcome challenges such as limited land
and food resources, while also developing important skills in observation,
research, and collaborative problem-solving.</p>

<p>As part of a separate activity on environmental sustainability, our Primary
3 students upcycled tote bags from old t-shirts. Through this hands-on
experience, they learnt that beyond reducing, reusing, and recycling, they
can also upcycle by creatively transforming old items into something new
and useful. The students were proud of their creations and look forward
to bringing their upcycled tote bags on their next outing!</p>

<p>As part of their learning of ancient civilisations, the Primary Six students
design and construct a model of an ancient civilization using MineCraft
Education, a game-based learning platform. In the planning phase of the
performance task, students collaborate in small groups to create a model
of their chosen ancient civilization using clay. Students apply what they
have learnt about the features and achievements of ancient civilisations
into constructing a clay model of the ancient civilisation. In the infinite
virtual world of MineCraft Education, students have the freedom to build
structures and add details like an irrigation system, farms, and livestock
to reflect the features and achievements of their chosen civilization.
Our school hopes to prepare our students for the real world by equipping
them with relevant skills and knowledge, like digital literacy and communication
skills, through authentic performance tasks.</p>
