Our school’s Social Studies team endeavours to shape our students into becoming ‘Informed, Concerned and Participative’ citizens. Social Studies prepares students for interacting with people of all cultures and communities and teaches them the relevance of history to current events in the 21st century. Guided by this objective, our team collaborates closely with subject specialists from MOE’s CPDD unit. As part of our professional development, our Social Studies teachers work to incorporate experiential learning into the subject by planning performance tasks and learning journeys. Through the learning of Social Studies, our students learn how to analyse information through a critical lens and gain the confidence and skills to conduct their own research.
