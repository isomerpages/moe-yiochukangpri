<p>Our school’s Social Studies team endeavours to shape our students into
becoming ‘Informed, Concerned and Participative’ citizens. Social Studies
prepares students for interacting with people of all cultures and communities
and teaches them the relevance of history to current events in the 21st
century. Guided by this objective, our team collaborates closely with subject
specialists from MOE’s CPDD unit. As part of our professional development,
our Social Studies teachers work to incorporate experiential learning into
the subject by planning performance tasks and learning journeys. Through
the learning of Social Studies, our students learn how to analyse information
through a critical lens and gain the confidence and skills to conduct their
own research.</p>
