<p>As we nurture self-directed student leaders, we aim for our students to
develop the ability to reflect on one’s actions and be caring individuals.
This undergirds the school’s student development efforts to develop students
who will have the heart to initiate change and ultimately give back to
the school community and beyond.</p>
