The YCK student leadership structure is premised on the beliefs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

* Every student can be a leader.

* Every student is responsible for his or her learning as a student leader.

* Every student can serve as a student leader.

# Our Structure & Approach
The 3 tiers of student leadership:
* Tier 1: Personal Leadership
This is a baseline student leadership development programme that includes all students from P1-P6. The school EDUCATES students on Personal leadership through CCE and school-wide value education programmes where the Social Emotional competencies of Self-Management and Responsible Decision-Making are strengthened.
* Tier 2: Class Leadership 
Tier 2 is made up of class committee leaders that include Class Monitors and Subject Monitors. As students take up class committee roles, they ENRICH their student experiences by applying responsible deciding making skills as well as putting into action the 6 school values. The Tier 2 leaders are Class Monitor, Reading Activist, Math Monitor, Science Monitor, MT Monitor, Aesthetics Monitor, PE Monitor, Eco Monitor and Cyber-wellness Monitor. 
Development of Tier 2 leaders include a student leader Start-of-Year Training by the Student Leadership committee and Subject Teachers-in-charge as well as on-the-job training.
* Tier 3: School Leadership

Student Leaders in Tier 3 forms the YCKPS Student Council which include the following group of student leaders:
* Prefectorial Board
* CCA leaders

Tier 3 student leaders exemplifies the heartbeat of student leadership in YCKPS and are the main drivers of school-wide initiatives and programmes. The programme and experiences for Tier 3 student leaders are geared towards **EMPOWERING** them to develop initiative to find solutions and give back to the school community. As Tier 3 student leaders, they will be guided to look within, from their thoughts to their action, before exploring how they can be a positive change to others.

**Tier 2 and 3 : Prefects Training Sessions**

Students who show further leadership potential are interviewed by the student leadership team teachers as well as our school leaders. They are then placed as trainee prefects on a probation of 6 months, before they are confirmed as prefects. Prefects who show keen interest in their roles are given the opportunity to assume EXCO roles within the prefectural board, after campaigning and an interview conducted by the school leaders
