# Our Structure & Approach
The 3 tiers of student leadership

The school **EDUCATES** students on Personal leadership through CCE and school-wide value education programmes where the Social Emotional competencies of Self-Management and Responsible Decision-Making are strengthened.
**Tier 2: Class Leadership**
 
Tier 2 is made up of class committee leaders that include Class Monitors and Subject Monitors. As students take up class committee roles, they **ENRICH** their student experiences by applying responsible deciding making skills as well as putting into action the 6 school values. The Tier 2 leaders are Class Monitor, Reading Activist, Math Monitor, Science Monitor, MT Monitor, Aesthetics Monitor, PE Monitor, Eco Monitor and Cyber-wellness Monitor. 
Development of Tier 2 leaders include a student leader Start-of-Year Training by the Student Leadership committee and Subject Teachers-in-charge as well as on-the-job training.
**Tier 3: School Leadership**

Student Leaders in Tier 3 forms the YCKPS Student Council which include the following group of student leaders:
* Prefectorial Board

Tier 3 student leaders exemplifies the heartbeat of student leadership in YCKPS and are the main drivers of school-wide initiatives and programmes. The programme and experiences for Tier 3 student leaders are geared towards **EMPOWERING** them to develop initiative to find solutions and give back to the school community.

As we nurture self-directed student leaders, we aim for our students to develop the ability to reflect on one’s actions and be caring individuals. This undergirds the school’s student development efforts to develop students who will have the heart to initiate change and ultimately give back to the school community and beyond.
