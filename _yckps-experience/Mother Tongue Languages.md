<h2>Key Focus</h2>

love for the Mother Tongue Languages and developing them into effective
communicators and users of the language. This continues to be the long
term belief of the department. The Mother Tongue Languages department focuses
on providing platforms for our students to develop their competencies in
listening, speaking, reading and writing skills and we provide various
programmes and learning activities for students to enjoy learning the Language
and to understand the Culture.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation of Primary 3 Higher Chinese Language Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>To further support our students’ bilingual development, our school has
introduced Higher Chinese Language (HCL) lessons at the Primary 3 level.
This new initiative reflects our commitment to nurturing a strong foundation
in Chinese Language and culture among our students from an early age.</p>
<p>The introduction of HCL at the lower primary level aims to further strengthen
students' learning of the language by providing more opportunities for
exposure, engagement, and deepened understanding. By identifying students
who demonstrate aptitude and interest in the Chinese Language, we are able
to support their learning through a more enriched curriculum.</p>
<p>This programme is designed to enthuse and stretch students who show the
potential to develop higher levels of Chinese Language proficiency and
cultural knowledge. The lessons go beyond the standard curriculum, incorporating
authentic learning experiences such as storytelling, interactive discussions,
and activities related to Chinese culture and heritage.</p>
<p>To support this, the Primary 3 Higher Chinese programme includes two additional
periods per week. These additional periods allow students to enjoy an early
and meaningful experience with ethnic literature and cultural knowledge
in a relaxed and engaging environment.</p>
<p>The school has also developed a set of in-house teaching resources, referencing
the "Culture Hut" (文化屋) section of the Primary 3 Higher Chinese textbook.
Cultural topics are organised into four major areas:</p>
<p>• 有趣的汉字 (The Fascinating Chinese Characters) – exploring the origins,
structure, and uniqueness of Chinese characters</p>
<p>• 经典故事 (Classic Stories) – introducing timeless Chinese folktales and
historical anecdotes</p>
<p>• 诗歌 (Poetry) – appreciating the beauty and rhythm of simple Chinese poems</p>
<p>• 节日 (Festivals) – understanding the customs and significance of traditional
Chinese festivals</p>
<p>Through this early exposure, we hope to motivate students in their Chinese
Language learning journey and foster a deeper appreciation of the rich
Chinese cultural traditions. It is our belief that when students are meaningfully
engaged, they develop greater confidence and intrinsic motivation to use
the language in various contexts.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our students thrive in this enriched learning
environment and grow into confident, bilingual individuals who take pride
in their cultural roots.</p>
