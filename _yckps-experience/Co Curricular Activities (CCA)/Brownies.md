<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3><strong>To explore and discover the world</strong></h3>
<p>The Brownies Mission is to enable girls to develop their fullest potential
as responsible citizens of the world. The Brownies get a sense of achievement
by earning proficiency badges through tests, field work and other activities
within the CCA. They develop a sense of camaraderie through variety of
games and group activities. Participation in activities such as North Division
Day and Combined Uniform Group Camp help to develop the girlsâ€™ Global Awareness
and Communication Skills.</p>
