<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3><strong>Go for Goal</strong></h3>
<p>The Football CCA aims to instill teamwork, discipline and respect to its
members. They undergo a structured training programme that will help them
progress from attaining individual skills to team tactics. Through the
activities, they learn to collaborate with one another and work as a team
to achieve their goals. The members are exposed to competitive football
by taking part annually in the National School Games Football Championships
for both boys and girls and other football events or friendly matches against
other teams.</p>
