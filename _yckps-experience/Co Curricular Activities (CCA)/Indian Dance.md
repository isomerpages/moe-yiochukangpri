<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3><strong>Feel the rhythm</strong></h3>
<p>Our students will learn basic to complex dance techniques. They will also
be taught to practise the school values as they go through their dance
sequences during training and formal platforms. The CCA provides opportunities
to put their knowledge and skills into practice through stage performances
in the school and beyond.</p>
