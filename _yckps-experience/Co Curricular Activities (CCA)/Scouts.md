<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3><strong>Be Prepared</strong></h3>
<p>Our Scouts CCA aims to develop life skills that can help them to face
and overcome challenges. The scouts are engaged in fun and meaningful activities,
that will see them pick up individual skills such as camp craft and first
aid, as well as, learn to work in a group setting. As they are engaged
in group activities, they develop critical thinking and their communication
skills. Leadership qualities are developed along the way and they participate
in programmes such as Sixers Camp and the Combined Uniform Group Camp,
to complement the CCAâ€™s activities.</p>
