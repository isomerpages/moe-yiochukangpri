<p style="text-align:center;"> I enjoy art lesson because I can show my creativity through my drawings. I have learnt to use the different colouring and drawing techniques for my drawings.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> I love PAL lessons because they are fun. For one lesson, we got to go to the music room and watch a video about a girl who went through some challenges and became stronger. It taught us that we should not give up. We also took part in music activities and went to the school garden to listen to the sounds of nature. It was relaxing to listen to birds chirping.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> The Applied Learning Programme eSTEM@YCKPS taught me how to contribute to a greener Singapore. My classmates and I got to go on a learning journey to an urban farm. I really enjoyed it because I got to learn how to grow various types of vegetables and even helped the urban farmers to plant some of them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy using my iPad for lessons as my teachers create fun activities for us. My favourite activity is ‘Time to Climb’ on Nearpod because I get to challenge my friends and it is a fun way to revise what I had learnt. It is also easier to do group activities with my friends using my iPad. We get to create mind-maps and word clouds, and I like that because we can see everyone’s responses and we get to use our mind-mapping skills to help in our revision.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">During my P2 PAL lessons, I created a robot with my group mates. We had to win games in order to earn fake money, which we could then use to buy items to build a robot. My group bought many toilet paper rolls to build our robot. I had a lot of fun because I liked working together with my classmates and we learnt how to work together well and not fight with one another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy being an Eco Monitor because I get to encourage friends to recycle and to do so correctly, such as putting the recyclables into the correct bins as part of our school-wide recycling efforts. I also like designing posters to spread the recycling message and to promote recycling. When we first started as Eco Monitors, we attended a training course where the teachers taught us how to become confident leaders. I feel that being an Eco Monitor is an important role because I lead by example and guide my schoolmates to be more environmentally responsible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">As a prefect, I help students such as guiding them to their classes and maintain order in the canteen. One fun thing I get to do as a prefect is play team-bonding games during prefect training sessions. I enjoy being a prefect because I get to help other students. It helped me develop courage as I sometimes have to give instructions to older students.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I like to dance at home, so I decided to join the Malay Dance CCA. I will sometimes even sing along as I dance! I get along very well with the other Malay Dance members, and we always have a good time talking and practising our routines during CCA sessions. Our CCA teachers also advise us on how to improve our dance techniques and always encourage us to improve. I would definitely recommend my juniors to join the Malay Dance CCA as they will create great memories!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I joined the Brownies because there are fun activities like camps and learning crafts such as making scrunchies. I enjoyed the camp because I learnt how to cook and got to visit the River Safari with my friends! My Brownies seniors and teachers have helped me a lot and I learnt how to respect everyone. It is like having many sisters!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I joined Volleyball because I can participate actively in a game that I really like. The love for Volleyball runs in my family, with my grandmother and mother being Volleyball players as well! Volleyball has given me leadership opportunities, such leading the members for our warm-up routines. These opportunities have helped me to understand the importance of clear and respectful communication with my members, thus helping me to grow as a leader. In addition, I also love participating in competitions. Competitions motivate me to be resilient. Even when we do not win, I believe that it is important to keep going and continue training hard. Our members also encourage each other a lot, which helps to boost the team morale.</p>
