<p>I like playing games during English Language lessons because they make
learning fun and exciting! My favourite is Four-in-a-Row. In the game,
we change words from present to past tense. It helps me learn and I always
have fun playing it with my friends!</p>

<p>I enjoy PAL lessons especially Sports and Games. I get to work together
with my friends.</p>

<p>I feel very excited each day as every day in school is very interesting!
I look forward to going for learning journeys with my classmates. I also
lead the class when we move around the school on the same level. My peers,
especially my buddies, help me by taking the lift with me. My teachers
and classmates are very inclusive and modify the lessons to ensure that
I can participate. For example, during Music lesson, they lift the bamboo
sticks higher and modify the steps for me to participate in the traditional
bamboo stick dance. I also become the second pair of eyes to help my PE
teacher monitor if any of my classmates are doing the movements wrongly.
I was also given the opportunity to participate in Readers’ Theatre recital
in front of the whole school during Assembly programme. In all, YCKPS develops
me well and I look forward to school!</p>

<p>During Chinese lesson, I use artificial intelligence (AI) on an iPad to
analyse my compositions. The AI will comment on how I can make improvements
in my writing skills. I like using the iPads for learning as we can ask
questions and the AI will customise its answer. It is very resourceful.</p>

<p>I joined recess busking this year because I was inspired by my favourite
singers. This is my first time singing a song in front of a crowd although
I have performed a dance item before. Even though I was shy, my teachers’
and friends’ encouragement and support gave me the courage to take part
in it.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to participate in Science Busking this year. I had
to build a model of a house and prepare speeches together with my teammates.
It was memorable as I get to experience the joy of being able to represent
the school in the competition together with my friends.</p>

<p>My classmates and I went for a Values in Action (VIA) project this year
at an active ageing centre. We prepared our own board games and some of
my classmates were chosen to do the presentation. It was very fun as we
folded origami with the elderly. We also played some board games with them.
The most memorable part was being able to interact with the elderly. Even
though most of them only spoke Chinese, we worked together with our classmates
to make everyone feel included.</p>

<p>My EPW experience taught me to be a good team player. My group worked
on a project about water conservation, creating slides to teach our schoolmates
how to save water. I helped design the slides with my friends. Although
we had different ideas at first, we listened to each other and worked it
out. My favourite part was the recess presentation where we got to display
our hard work to our schoolmates!</p>

<p>I join Football (Boys) CCA because I enjoy playing the sport and want
to learn new skills. Aside from competitions, we are also given opportunities
to participate in mini matches to practise the skills that we have learnt
and experience the excitement of competing together as a team. It also
keeps me physically active and helps me to communicate better with others!</p>

<p>I join Scouts CCA because I look forward to going for camps. I have participated
in a few camps including school-based combined uniformed group camp and
external camps. My most memorable event was the Sixer Camp where we learnt
skills such as helping to resolve a conflict. I also enjoy cooking our
own noodles using metal tin. I am thankful to my teachers for choosing
me and giving me the opportunity to participate in the Sixer Camp!</p>

<p>I enjoy being in the Angklung and Kulintang CCA, which I’ve been part
of for three years. Although I wasn’t keen at first, I grew to love playing
instruments and made many friends. I struggled with reading music at the
start but improved over time. My favourite memory was bonding with the
Primary 6 seniors. We eventually became a 'closely-knitted family'.</p>
