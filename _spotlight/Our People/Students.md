<p style="text-align:center;"> I like playing games during English lessons because they make learning fun and exciting! My favourite is Four-in-a-Row.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> I enjoy PAL lessons especially Sports and Games. I get to work together with my friends.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> I feel very excited each day as every day in school is very interesting! I look forward to going for learning journeys with my classmates. I also lead the class when we move around the school on the same level. My peers, especially my buddies, help me by taking the lift with me. My teachers and classmates are very inclusive and modify the lessons to ensure that I can participate. For example, during Music lesson, they lift the bamboo sticks higher and modify the steps for me to participate in the traditional bamboo stick dance. I also become the second pair of eyes to help my PE teacher monitor if any of my classmates are doing the actions wrongly or accidentally injury themselves. I was also given the opportunity to participate in Readers’ Theatre recital in front of the whole school during Assembly programme. In all, YCKPS fits me well and I look forward to school! </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I joined recess busking this year because I was inspired by my favourite singers. This is my first time singing a song in front of a crowd although I have performed a dance item before. Even though I was shy, my teachers’ and friends’ encouragement and support gave me the courage to take part in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">My EPW experience taught me to be a good team player. My group worked on a project about water conservation, creating slides to teach our schoolmates how to save water. I helped design the slides with my friends. Although we had different ideas at first, we listened to each other and worked it out. My favourite part was the recess presentation where we got to show off our hard work to our schoolmates!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I joined Football (Boys) CCA because I enjoy playing the sport and want to learn new skills. Aside from competitions, we are also given opportunities to participate in mini matches to practise the skills that we have learnt and experience the excitement of competing together as a team. It also keeps me physically active and helps me to communicate better with others!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I joined Scouts CCA because I wanted to go for camps. I have participated in a few camps including school-based combined uniformed group camp and external camps. My most memorable event was the Sixer Camp where we learnt skills such as helping to resolve a conflict. I also enjoyed cooking our own noodles using metal tin. I am thankful to my teachers for choosing me and giving me the opportunity to participate in the Sixer Camp!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy being in the Angklung and Kulintang CCA, which I’ve been part of for three years. Although I wasn’t keen at first, I grew to love playing instruments and made many friends. I struggled with reading music at the start but improved over time. My favourite memory was bonding with the Primary 6 seniors. We eventually became a close-knit family.</p>
