Science Buskers Festival 2018
-----------------------------

Science Buskers Festival 2018 serves as a platform for participants to do a “show-and-tell” on any science topic with the aims of developing one’s communication skills through expressions of science in creative manners, and inspiring an interest in science. Two of our teams made it to the grand final!Click [here](https://yiochukangpri.moe.edu.sg/departments/science) to find out more!

2018 Children’s Day concert
---------------------------

The theme for the 2018 Children’s Day concert was “Super Heroes”. School leaders, teachers, parents from the Parents Support Group (PSG) and even our very own Sports Programme Executive (SPE) Mr Sean Wong, put up scintillating, sporting and entertaining performances that brought to the fore, the message of optimism, resilience and gratitude to our children in YCKPS.

  

A Super Hero, is resilient, who never gives up and tries his/her best to overcome trials and tribulations. In life, when everything seems all doom and gloom, a Super Hero would come to our rescue. At the end of the day, we are eternally grateful to the Super Hero who saves our day.

  

In the eyes of the children, these Super Heroes exist in our everyday life. He/She may be a friend, parent, family member or relative, teacher, school staff or even a stranger. Hence, Super Heroes act as children's role models to show them the will, courage and resolve to emulate the many outstanding values and qualities of a Super Hero - Defender of the weak, upholding justice and righteousness and the moral courage to put the wrong things right. Finally, children, representing the future of the human race, need empathy and respect to demonstrate gratitude towards the Super Heroes who have helped them along in life’s journey and pay it forward.

  

Indeed this year’s annual Children's Day concert marks yet another fun, exciting and memorable occasion that truly exemplifies the spirit of the YCKPS family and commemorates the celebratory joys of being a child.

Learning takes place beyond the classrooms as students engaged in cross-cultural understanding, negotiations during collaboration and interactive learning journeys. Students also have opportunities to explore different learning applications using iPads to consolidate their learning.

Chinese New Year Celebration
----------------------------

The 2018 Chinese New Year Celebration was organized successfully!

  

The Chinese New Year concert started with Principal’s speech which reminded students to be grateful for the peaceful and prosperous life now in Singapore and to treasure the time with family members and appreciate what we have.

  

Students then went on to watch the Chinese New Year well wishes video in which Vice Principals and teachers wish each and every one a joyous New Year celebration. Students also watched in awe as our Chinese Dance members performed.

  

Parents and teachers were invited to come together to do a calligraphy of “大地回春”. Students enjoyed the beautiful calligraphy work done by teachers and parents.

  

We then gave out the Best Decorated Classroom award for each level. Students felt proud of their own effort and everyone cheered for each other when the class won the Best Decorated Classroom award for Chinese New Year.

  

We ended with a bang with the Lion Dance performance. This was the finale which livened up the entire atmosphere!

Lab On Wheels

On 18th and 19th January 2018, our P4 and P5 students went on board a tech bus titled 'Lab On Wheels' to experience a programming workshop entitled 'Robot Rattle'.

  

Students learnt programming concepts and logic to activate an online robot. The online robot was able to complete various tasks, including pushing a ball, picking up a box and loading the boxes onto a container.

  

The workshop allowed the students to develop logical thinking and problem solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes. Students also worked in pairs and learned through peer-learning.
