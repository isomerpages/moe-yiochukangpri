Homecoming Day
--------------

Since 2017, we welcomed the past batches of old boys and girls of YCKPS at the school canteen at the end of each year. In this inaugural event, the casual environment set the mood for ex-student and teachers to catch up with each other on the latest happenings in their lives and reminisce the good old times of the yesteryears. Besides dedicating songs and photo taking, the old boys and girls did not go away disappointed without savoring the unforgettable Sapiah’s black pepper chicken rice.  

  

A picture paints a thousand words - the photos below are very meaningful to us. It shows the bond between our old boys and girls with their teachers.

Children's Day Concert
----------------------

There was magic in the air for the 2019 Children’s Day concert. The concert theme “Magical YCKPS” encapsulates the excited and captive audience who were enthralled by the breath-taking performances of the teachers and school staff.

  

First, a comical video, enacted by Upper Primary teachers, showed how “YCKPS Got Magic” and followed by an intriguing and hilarious talent contest – “YCKPS Got Magic”. Next, the Lower Primary and Middle Primary teachers and staff made the famous characters of Disney and Toy Story Land come alive by wearing colourful costumes and strutting along to the stage as well as dancing to the upbeat music on stage. Finally, the PSG sponsored guest magician, Lay Cheng, entertained everyone with bag of comedy magic tricks. Even our principal, Mr Ng, chipped in with a finale song cum guitar rendition of Kermit the frog: “Rainbow Connection”.

  

Magic has always fascinated and appealed to children of all ages because of the imaginary special powers that make the seemingly impossible happen. Through the concert, the children learnt the virtue of magic by dreaming to do good and accomplishing insurmountable tasks in the face of challenging circumstances e.g. bending metal spoons. In addition, magic spreads the message of hope and belief through the restoration of anything broken to its original state. Hence, children when faced with life challenges can choose to remain optimistic, determined and resilient yet believing that magic could very well happen at the end.

  

Indeed, there was a consensus amongst the children that this year’s Children’s Day concert was the most memorable to date and bears the hallmark stamp of a truly unique YCKPS experience!

2019 P3 VIA Buddy Clean Workshop
--------------------------------

Our Primary 3 students participated in the NEA Buddy Clean Workshop on 2 May 2019. During the 3-hour workshop, students were educated the importance of keeping our school clean and encouraged to take ownership of the cleanliness of the school and environment. Besides teamwork and communication skills, they were also equipped with various cleaning skills, which they put to practice immediately during the workshop to clean up their own classrooms as well as common areas like the canteen and corridors in the school. We believe that it is important to cultivate among the young in the daily cleaning, starting from their personal space to the school environment and community, so that they form good habits that can benefit them throughout their lives. Over some period, they will learn to take care of themselves, learn to be self-reliance and also able to show graciousness when in public.

Experimenting the use of Coding in the teaching of Mathematics
--------------------------------------------------------------

2 of our colleagues decided to design another lesson that used Sphero for students to apply the concept learnt in the 8-point compass after seeing the joy in students to see Mathematics concept coming alive during their previous experiment. This time, students hone their communication skills so that they could programme their Sphero to complete the challenges. The students worked in pairs. One student will use the 8 point compass direction to communicate to the other student so that he can apply the code for Sphero to move in the specific direction. Teamwork and the clarity of instructions by applying what they learnt in 8 point compass were the takeaways for the lesson.
