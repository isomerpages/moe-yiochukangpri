School Musical - Mulan
----------------------

![School Musical - Mulan](/images/musical_1.jpg)

Once again, YCKPS students have done themselves proud under the spotlight! The triennial school musical is one of the initiatives by the school to provide our students a platform for creative expression, showcasing their talents and developing themselves into a confident speakers and learners.

  

This year, the school put up a production from Mulan Disney Junior so as to enable our students to learn the enduring values from the famous story of Mulan. From this production, cast members and the main student body learnt about caring for the family, doing ones’ best, doing what is right and perseverance. All these are tied to the school values of Care, Upright, Progressive and Excellence. Mass auditions were held earlier in the year to give all students the opportunity to be part of the musical. 50 students were selected to be in the final cast. They went through extensive training for 4 months to prepare themselves for their respective roles.

A total of 130 students from the six Performing Arts groups also proudly displayed their talents at the musical production. The audience enjoyed the wonderful and humorous performance by YCKPS own talented students, supported by our dedicated staff. All these would also not be possible without the tremendous support from the parents.

Childrens' Day Celebration
--------------------------

This year’s Children’s Day concert theme: “Children are Special – Our Wishes for You” was captured succinctly in the exciting introductory video that outlines the historical origins of Children Day to explain why children are universally special. In addition, the theme outlines the present challenges children face and the future hopes and dreams for children on this special day.

  

To kick-off the concert, the School Leaders presented their three wishes for the children. The children laughed at the P3/P4 teachers’ sporting antics and colourful outfits as the P3/P4 teachers wished them a lively curiosity of things around them through the game of “Guessing the Movie Titles."

Some cried listening to personalized lyrics in the P5/P6 teachers’ ukulele item as they wished the children to always experience love in spite of who they are in an adapted rendition song: “Students Whom We Love - We Will Always Love You!"

Others were inspired by the P1/P2 teachers’ “Fight Song” and energetic dance for the children to always be resilient and persevere despite challenges faced.

Many sang along in spontaneous unison to the familiar tunes of Chopsticks Brothers’ “The Little Apple -  小苹果” and Ed Sheeran’s hit “The Shape of You”; created an electrifying hair-raising atmosphere that brought the house down with the PSG Potpourri Dance medley. The mothers’ dance encouraged the children to be brave and step out of their comfort zone to try new challenges just like the PSG dancing mothers did.

For the finale, our Principal Mr Ng’s solo guitar and song performance: “If We Hold On Together” wished for the children to support each other and work together towards a better tomorrow. Throughout the concert, the children were participative, captivated and their hearts touched. Teachers also waved their hands in the air and clapped along with the children. The magical atmosphere created epitomizes a facet of the YCKPS school spirit.

  

Despite their busy commitments, the teachers and parents took time to prepare and practice for their Children’s Day concert items. It was an expression of the love they had for the children and to role model one's courage to step out of one’s comfort zone to make a contribution. The rare occasions of adults performing for children are positive memories that would forever be etched in the children’s and adults’ minds too because these experiences are really out of the ordinary.

  

True to the saying: “It takes a village to raise a child”, every one of us play a part to create the uniquely YCKPS experience for our children.

Nanogirl Science Show @ YCKPS

Dr Michelle Dickinson is a passionate researcher and teacher with a love for Science and Engineering. A senior lecturer in Engineering at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, Dr Dickinson brought her **Nanogirl Science Show** specially to the Singapore Science Festival 2017 and Yio Chu Kang Primary School!

  

The students were treated to a series of exciting Science activities of shooting an airzooka, crushing tin cans and burning soap bubbles during the show. Dr Dickinson showed us that Science happens everywhere and for everyone, and does not have to be limited to only the Science classroom in school. She also showed the students how they can be superheroes with superpowers simply by using the Science around them.
