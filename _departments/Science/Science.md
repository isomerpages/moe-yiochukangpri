Our Science Department aims to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry in our pupils. The school curriculum and programmes seeks to help pupils acquire (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes so as to view Science as meaningful and applicable in their daily life.

In the classrooms, pupils do activities to conceptualise knowledge. The activities are built on inquiry and imagination. Pupils are provided with opportunities to use concepts and integrate skills and processes to inquire things and phenomena around them.

Signature Programmes
--------------------

### **Science Assembly Programme and Exhibition**

#### **\- Incredible Edibles – The Chemistry of Cookies**

On 27 August, Science Centre Singapore and Kate Mulcahy presented Incredible Edibles – The Chemistry of Cookies during our assembly programme. This 40-minute show featured a selection of exciting demonstrations coupled with interesting food facts! Our students participated in the process of making cookies and learnt about the science behind the various chemical reactions!

This show is part of the Singapore Science Festival 2018 and it is our second year of partnership with Science Centre Singapore to encourage the joy of learning science in our students!

#### **\- Inflatable Digestive System**  

As part of the Singapore Science Festival 2018, Science Centre Singapore had also set up an inflatable float featuring the human digestive system in our school. Our Primary 3 and 4 students had so much fun with the float as they learnt about the digestive system at the same time!

#### **Science Buskers Festival 2018**  

As part of the Singapore Science Festival 2018, Science Buskers Festival 2018 serves as a platform for participants to do a “show-and-tell” on any science topic with the aims of developing one’s communication skills through expressions of science in creative manners, and inspiring an interest in science.

This year, five teams from our school took part in this competition. Of which, our Thirsty Wizards and Explorers of the Galaxy made it past the preliminary round and into the grand final! These two teams performed at Plaza Singapura, and our Thirsty Wizards did us proud by winning the Voters’ Choice Award! They communicated science in such engaging and interactive manner that awed the judges and public, and won the top-choice team amongst all the votes casted.

See our two finalists in action:

Not forgetting the other three teams who also participated in the Science Buskers Festival 2018:

**Sound Busketeers**

The Sound Busketeers presented on how effects of sound could be observed using everyday objects such as baking materials. They also demonstrated how different sounds could be heard.

**Sparkling Unicorns**

The team created a substance called Oobleck, which is a non-newtonian fluid with constant viscosity. They presented on how they had made the Oobleck using a mixture of cornstarch and water, and showed its properties of both solids and liquids.

**Powerful Eggs**

The team did a simple demonstration using the concept of pressure to explain why eggs do not break when hens sit on them. They explained the unique curved shape of an egg which helps to distribute pressure evenly over the shell and thereby giving it a tremendous strength to withstand the weight of a hen.
