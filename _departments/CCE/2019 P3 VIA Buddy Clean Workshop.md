Our Primary 3 students participated in the NEA Buddy Clean Workshop on 2 May 2019. During the 3-hour workshop, students were educated the importance of keeping our school clean and encouraged to take ownership of the cleanliness of the school and environment. Besides teamwork and communication skills, they were also equipped with various cleaning skills, which they put to practice immediately during the workshop to clean up their own classrooms as well as common areas like the canteen and corridors in the school. We believe thatÂ it is important to cultivate among the young in the daily cleaning, starting from their personal space to the school environment and community, so that they form good habits that can benefit them throughout their lives. Over some period, they will learn to take care of themselves, learn to be self-reliance and also able to show graciousness when in public.
