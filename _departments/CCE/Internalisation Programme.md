**2018 Immersion Trip to Shanghai, China**  
  
A total of 23 students from Primary 4 & 5 went for the 2018 Immersion Trip to Shanghai from 27 May 2018 to 31 May 2018. Students learned more about the Chinese culture and Chinese arts. Besides visiting the various places of interest in Shanghai, such as The Bund, Shanghai Ocean Aquarium and Qi Bao Ancient Town, they also visited our twinning school, Shanghai No. 1 School. Through this trip, students developed global awareness and cross-cultural skills during their interactions with their Shanghai counterparts.

**How did we feel about the trip?**  

At Shanghai No.1 School, we learned paper cutting. The Art teacher taught us how to cut a star. All we had to do was fold the paper and cut, it may sound easy but the cutting needed to be precise and the paper neatly folded. Even though we had many difficulties, we enjoyed and found it interesting. The teacher was very patient with us and he helped us and also showed us the artworks that he did.

Throughout the trip, I have learnt to be more responsible. One of my favourite places during the trip was the Science and Technology Museum. The robots on display could do many things like solving a Rubik cube and responding to commands. I hope to have the opportunity to take part in more immersion trips in the future.

The food in Shanghai was amazing. I hope to have a chance to attend PE lessons at Shanghai No 1 School and also get to see more of the school’s facilities. I wished I was able to go into Shanghai Tower and having more time to explore 七宝古镇 too.

The 5-day trip was definitely exciting and interesting. On the 2nd day, we had English lessons with our Shanghai friends. They were very attentive in class and even raised their hands up so straight! On the 4th day, we went to the China Art Museum. There were hundreds of paintings there and every one of them has some meanings. I was really curious as I explored the gallery. Overall, I enjoyed the whole trip and I will definitely return to Shanghai.
