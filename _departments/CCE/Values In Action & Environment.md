Overview

**As an important component of Character and Citizenship Education, the overarching mission of our Values in Action (VIA) programmes aims to instil in our students, graciousness and keenness to serve the community and nation, thus preparing them for a lifetime of active citizenship.**
**We adopted a whole school approach in providing learning experiences for students to exercise social responsibility in their spheres of influence and play their part through meaningful contribution to the school and community. In support of Keep Singapore Clean Movement, our school-initiated VIA programmes focuses on care for our environment.**

Buddy Clean Workshop for the Primary 3s
---------------------------------------

  

In our effort to extend our hands to serve the school community and in line with the Keep Singapore Clean Movement in schools, all Primary 3 students were engaged in a capacity building workshop titled “Buddy Clean Workshop” launched by NEA. This programme aims to educate our students to be socially responsible, and caring citizens with good character. The learning experience also provides students the opportunity to learn the various skills required for cleaning as well as effective communication and active listening skills. Students leverage on peer influence and feedback to shape behaviour and foster shared ownership and responsibility of common spaces.

Here are some highlights from the workshop:

Tray Outreach Programme @ Ci Yuan Hawker
----------------------------------------

  

Our Primary 3 to 5 Ecopals put values into actions by participating in the outreach programme at Ci Yuan Hawker Centre on 12 July, 19 July and 2 August 2018.  They learnt the importance of social graciousness and built confidence in them to remind patrons to return their trays. The Ecopals also fielded questions on the advocacy and the school’s values education programme.

Clean and Green Singapore Carnival – “Eco School Day 2018”
----------------------------------------------------------

On 5 November 2018, 28 selected Ecopals from Primary 3 to 6 visited the Clean and Green Singapore (CGS) Carnival – “Eco School Day 2018”. It was organised by the National Environment Agency at Wisma Geylang Serai. Some of the activities include “Recycle It Right, “Bin Your Litter”, “Aim at the Good Habits” and “Pledge to Save Water”.

Through these activities, our Ecopals gained insights on responsibility to the environment. This will help them champion saving the environment in school.

ViA Exposition and Kindness Week
--------------------------------

  
It is the time of the year again for our students to showcase their Values In Action projects that were done during their Values in Action Learning Experience in school. The 1-week long exposition was carried out during the Kindness Week in Term 2 Week 9. Besides involving all students in school-initiated VIA programs, we also collaborated with Social Change in Action (SoCH) to encourage student ownership of VIA activities through students-initiated projects, in support of the global programme Design for Change Movement. Through the planning and implementing of these student initiated VIA projects, students acquire the 21st century competencies and skills. This year, all our Primary 5 students also took the opportunity to serve as Water Conservation Ambassadors to educate their school mates on the ways of saving water and importance of conserving water during the exposition.
