As part of the Junior Civil Defence Lionhearters Programme, selected P4 and P5 Scouts and Brownies attended hard-skill training on 27 July 2018.

  

The objective of the training was to equip the pupils with essential emergency preparedness skills and knowledge to better prepare them for emergencies that may occur. During the training, students were introduced basic First Aid as well as CPR-AED skills. Students also learnt about general fire safety tips and the preventive measures in the event of a fire.  

  

Upon completing the programme, pupils had the opportunity to take on student leadership roles as Emergency Preparedness Ambassadors in school. They also demonstrated their skills and shared their learning on Total Defence Day.
