Singapore has remained safe and peaceful over the past 53 years because of all Singaporeans’ efforts in carrying out Total Defence. It continues to be relevant because the threats we face today require everyone to come forth and play their part.

In living out the TDD theme for this year – “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, a slew of activities were organised on 11 February 2019. The activities aimed to drive across the key messages that every pupil can play his/her part in Total Defence and our collective effort is needed to keep our nation strong. Click **[here]()** to find out more!
