**_TEROKA SI CILIK - AMAZING RACE FOR THE LITTLE ONES AT NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION_**

A total of 8 of our P4 ML students participated in Teroka Si Cilik, an Amazing Race-like event organised by the NTU/NIE Malay Language and Cultural Society in March 2017. By participating in this event, our students not only had fun, but were also able to sharpen their oracy skills in the Malay language, learn about the Malay culture and work in a team. At the end of the race, they were rewarded with a win by coming in as _**First Runner-Up.**_

**_APPOINTMENT OF RAKAN BAHASA (Malay Language Ambassador)_**

Rakan Bahasa is an initiative by the Malay Language Council, Singapore, to encourage students who excel in the Malay Language to spread the love of the language to their peers, friends and families. Students nominated as Rakan Bahasa are those who are passionate about the Malay language and culture, can be a role model to their peers and are able to enrich the lives of others through the creative expression and usage of Malay. We are proud that 2 of our P4 ML students were nominated and eventually appointed as Rakan Bahasa this year. They are, Muhammad Akasyah Bin Daud from 4 Care, and Puteri Elnyssa Risdiyanti Bte Abdullah from 4 Respect. In fulfilling their duties, one of them was selected to serve as a reporter during the launch of the Malay Language Month in September this year.
