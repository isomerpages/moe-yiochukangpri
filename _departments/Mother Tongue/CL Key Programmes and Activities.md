2018 P4 CL Cultural Camp
------------------------

  
Every year, the Primary 4 students taking Chinese Language participate in a half-day cultural camp to immerse themselves in an environment using the Chinese Language and learning about the Chinese Culture. This year, our P4 students enjoyed themselves thoroughly as they were involved in interesting and unique activities - **Wushu (武术),  Blowing Painting (吹画) and Fragrant Pouch Making (香囊制作).**

From a blot of paint, our students used their creativity to produce a unique and beautiful tree filled with plum blossoms~ They used a short straw and blew carefully in the direction the tree branches were to spread out to.

2018 Chinese Cultural Exposure Scheme (CPES)
--------------------------------------------

  

The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) endeavour by the Ministry of Education, is aimed at enhancing our students’ understanding and knowledge of the Chinese Language and the Chinese Culture beyond the school. In support of this initiative, our Chinese Language Department organised a learning journey for our P4 Chinese Language students and selected P5 Chinese Language students to watch a Chinese drama performance ‘Bao Xiao Long Zhua Zei Ji’ (包小龙抓贼记) by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Arts and Cultural Troupe on 22 March 2018, Thursday (Term 2, Week 1).  It was a fun and exciting activity for the students as few of them have the experience of watching a drama at the theatre.

Chinese words were flashed on the screen as it was being said during the drama skit. Our students learnt many new good phrases!

The actors from the drama sprung into life by coming to the audience area and asking them about their opinions on the identity of the thief in the show!

Digital Book Trail《名著故事之旅》
--------------------------

  
杨厝港小学华文部为了学生设计了《名著故事之旅》。学生在第三学期的第三和第四周内进行了一系列与中国四大名著有关的活动。华文教师们在课堂上与学生分享了《西游记》、《水浒传》和《三国演义》的故事内容，然后学生再利用平板电脑在校内进行了故事之旅。  

  
The Chinese Language department created a Chinese Language Book Trail based on 3 great Chinese Masterpieces. Teachers shared with students on few segments of the stories in Pilgrimage to the West; Journey to the West, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Heroes of the Marshes; Water Margins respectively. Students then went on a book trail to learn more about the characters and content of the book.

The theme and focus for this year’s Chinese Language Fortnight is “Filial Piety”. Our students were given the chance to get in touch with the most valued value in the Chinese Culture.
