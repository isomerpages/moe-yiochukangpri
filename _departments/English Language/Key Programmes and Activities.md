Holistic assessment in our context refers to the ongoing gathering of information on different facets of a child from various sources, with the aim of providing qualitative and quantitative feedback to support and guide the child's development. Holistic assessment informs teachers on their teaching practice and guides them in the design and delivery of student learning. It will also enable parents to support their children's development an

#### **Broadly, holistic assessment emphasises the following four key aspects:**

*   Focusing on the development of the whole child
*   Striking a balance between AoL (Assessment Of Learning) andAfL (Assessment For Learning) practices
*   Guiding teachers in the design and delivery of their practices
*   Using appropriate methods and modes of assessment

### DEAR: **D**rop **E**verything **A**nd **R**ead Programme

### Primary 1 – Primary 6

Believing in reading as a main antecedent of English language proficiency in the various EL skill domains, our school promotes active reading by establishing a pervasive reading culture through our differentiated, data-driven and ICT-based structured reading programme through the identification and matching of students’ Lexile profile (reading comprehension proficiency levels) with age-appropriate books.


### PECS Pre-Assembly Programme:

### **P**romoting  **E**nglish  **C**ulture to  **S**tudents  Programme

### Primary 1 – Primary 6

In line with the general EL direction of the school and to achieve student outcomes, we see the need to build a robust EL culture within school in which the richness, vibrancy, interest and love for the language can be seeded and flourish within students.

  

### PILOT Programme:

### **P**ushing **I**ndividual **L**imits **O**f **T**alent

### Primary 4 – Primary 5

Recognising the learning needs of our high ability learners, the EL PILOT programme is calibrated to their learning inclinations in which their potential can be better stretched.
