Benjamin Yeo

Class of 2021

My CCA is soccer. I enjoy playing on the school soccer team with my friends and training with them. When I play, I get to know more people from the team, and at the same time, improve my soccer skills. I enjoy the soccer CCA as there are fun games as part of the training, and the coach makes funny jokes. During soccer tournaments, I can prove that I have learned the skills and perform them during the game. I also feel proud representing my school to win.

Mr Martin Chan

Vice-Principal

One fundamental value that we wish to develop in all YCKPS students is grit. Learning is a lifelong journey so we want our students to develop the resilience to overcome whatever challenges they may face in the process of learning. They must be adaptable and develop the relevant skills and competencies in the new future. My vision of a YCKPS student after six years in the school would be a confident person who maximises his or her strengths. The school will provide the opportunities and platforms for our students by providing them with a myriad of learning experiences. We will continually strive to provide the best for our students, to cultivate the seeds of learning in them and most importantly, igniting the spark in them to discover, develop and deepen their learning.

Vice-Principal

When I started my journey as a newly appointed School Leader in Dec 2019, I was filled with a lot of aspirations and ideas. However with COVID -19, things took a different turn and days were filled with data collection and submission. A positive outcome through these events was the bonds I have forged with parents as I worked with them hand in hand. In the last few months, my relationships with parents have strengthened and I am able to garner their support for the school. I now have an intimate knowledge of which child has a sibling in which class and what their parents do for a living. What I enjoy most in my current capacity is the time I get to spend with the students, getting to know them as individuals. I love listening to their account of their day in school and what they like and look forward to.

Class of 2021

My CCA is Chinese Dance. I love to dance and I will perform on stage at least once a year. I have done many different types of dance, including Hip Hop, Ballet, Tap and Gymnastics. My favourite memory in YCKPS so far is participating in 2019 YCKPS Got Talent. In the talent competition, every participant will get to show off their talent. As for me, I did a dance and gymnastic routine. It was so fun and I loved to be on stage. Through dance, I have learnt how to use my hands and face to tell a story.

Primary 6

My favourite thing to do in YCKPS is having music lessons. I want to become a singer when I grow up. I decided to join Voices of Singapore and this encouraged me to sing and join the school choir as I wanted to learn more about music and sing more songs. In the school choir, I get to meet new people and perform on stage, which I love to do!

I enjoy PAL (Programme for Active Learning) because we get to do a lot of activities like running around, playing sports and games and learning outdoors. I learn how to notice other people’s feelings through the activities that we do.

From the moment your child enters the gate of Yio Chu Kang Primary, the seed of learning is sown, to be cared and nurtured to be a Youth of Character, Keen to Serve. This is done through careful curation of school programmes, activities and experiences delivered through interactions with and the collaborative efforts of our People within our village - School Leaders, teaching and non-teaching staff, present and past students, and parents. Every stakeholder plays a pivotal role in helping to shape and mould your child. We believe, as an African proverb goes, it takes a village to raise a child.

Mdm Siti Hadzzier

Lower Primary Teacher  
Learning Support Coordinator

In order to create a safe learning environment for my students, I impart and incorporate the school values, such as respect and care, in my daily teaching. By doing so, my students are encouraged to share their ideas and take risks. They are also not fearful of asking questions and making mistakes. They understand that making mistakes is part of learning. Hence, they are not afraid to keep trying.

Class of 2015 Raffles Institution

A fond memory I had in YCKPS was the time I participated in the school musical in 2014, playing the role of Prince Eric in “The Little Mermaid”. Having to perform in front of the school and a crowd of strangers was a new and interesting experience for me, and it definitely helped in developing my confidence in myself and in my abilities. I am glad for the opportunity to have been a part of the musical.

Primary 5

I am very curious about everything around me and it makes me want to discover more. This is why I enjoy learning because I want to know more about things and how they work. I enjoy coming to school as I get to learn. Apart from learning in the classroom, one of my favourite spots in the school before the Circuit Breaker was the playground. That was the time when I got to play with all my friends during recess.

Primary 4

During my P2 PAL lessons, I created a robot with my group mates. We had to win games in order to earn fake money, which we could then use to buy items to build a robot. My group bought many toilet paper rolls to build our robot. I had a lot of fun because I liked working together with my classmates and we learnt how to work together well and not fight with one another.

Class of 2021

My favourite thing to do in YCKPS is talking to my friends and teachers. They have been so friendly from the day I first came to the school in 2018. I remember travelling on the aeroplane to Singapore and wondering if I would have any friends. Though I still miss my friends from my old school in England, I am still very grateful for the many friends I have here. My teachers are also very caring. They care for our well-being, making sure that we don't have any problems at school and that we are happy.

Class of 2018 Cedar Girls' Secondary

One of my most memorable events in YCKPS was participating in the Science fair, where we won the gold award. My group mates and I bonded over the experiments we carried out. It was a fun and interesting experience. Through the competition, I learnt how to work with others. We had to hand-sew a lot of things in a short period of time. Luckily, we managed to split the workload and work together to complete the project on time. Now, I can make use of the experience I have gained in other projects. In school, I am able to lead projects better and complete them efficiently.

Mr Louis Loo

Head of Department (Science)

Being a Science teacher in YCKPS, I believe that Science is all around us. YCKPS provides a great environment for students to promote the teaching and learning of Science. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Environmental-STEM (ESTEM@YCKPS), is developed with the intention of providing students with the opportunity to learn more about the environment and sustainable living. Students collaborate with one another in this programme to co-construct their knowledge of critical environmental issues.

Primary 6

I was at a school in China before coming to YCKPS. When I first came here, I was very surprised as there were so many differences between YCKPS and my previous school. However, I was able to record my feelings about these differences in an art journal that my art teacher encouraged me to draw in every day. I became better at drawing because of this and I also made many friends who enjoyed drawing like me.

Mr Alex Leong

Associate member  
Parent Support Group

I joined Parent Support Group (PSG) with the intention of wanting to understand more about the school and hopefully, be able to contribute something which is of value. I believe that anything that benefits the school will ultimately be beneficial for our children as well. PSG provides the platform to not only contribute to our children’s education, but also to spend more time with them. Through PSG, I have seen the dedication of the school staff in YCKPS and my wife and I are heartened to know that the school’s direction does not just focus on academic results, but the overall well-being of the students as well.
