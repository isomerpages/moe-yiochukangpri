<p style="text-align:center;">I love PAL lessons because they are fun. For one lesson, we got to go to the music room and watch a video about a girl who went through some bad times. We also took part in music activities and went to the school garden to listen to the sounds of nature. It was relaxing to listen to birds chirping</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy PAL (Programme for Active Learning) because we get to do a lot of activities like running around, playing sports and games and learning outdoors. I learn how to notice other people’s feelings through the activities that we do.</p>
