<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy PAL (Programme for Active Learning) because we get to do a lot of activities like running around, playing sports and games and learning outdoors. I learn how to notice other people’s feelings through the activities that we do.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy using my iPad for lessons as my teachers create fun activities for us. My favourite activity is Time to Climb on Nearpod because I get to challenge my friends and it is a fun way to revise what I had learnt. It is also easier to do group activities with my friends using my iPad. We get to create mind-maps and word clouds, and I like that because we can see what everyone’s responses.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">During my P2 PAL lessons, I created a robot with my group mates. We had to win games in order to earn fake money, which we could then use to buy items to build a robot. My group bought many toilet paper rolls to build our robot. I had a lot of fun because I liked working together with my classmates and we learnt how to work together well and not fight with one another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy being an Eco Monitor because I get to encourage friends to recycle and to do so correctly, such as putting the recyclables into the correct bins. I also like designing posters to spread the recycling message and to promote recycling efforts. When we first started as Eco Monitors, we attended a training course where the teachers taught us how to become confident leaders. I feel that being an Eco Monitor is an important role because I lead by example and guide my schoolmates to be more environmentally responsible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I like to dance at home, so I decided to join the Malay Dance CCA. I will sometimes even sing along as I dance! I get along very well with the other Malay Dance members, and we always have a good time talking and practising our routines during CCA sessions. One thing I am proud of is our preparation for this year’s Hari Raya virtual concert. Due to Covid-19 safe management measures, we could not perform “live”. However, my friends and I managed to celebrate Hari Raya with the whole school through a recorded performance. It was very fun and we even got to choose our own costumes! I would definitely recommend my juniors to join the Malay Dance CCA as they will create great memories!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I have been interested in football since I was in Primary 1. I especially admire Christiano Ronaldo. I love playing in football matches with friends; we get to appreciate each others’ unique skills. The most memorable experience was when out team won a soccer competition this year! During Foootball CCA sessions, we practise out positioning and ball footwork, and time passes by so quickly because we all have so much fun! I would like to tell my juniors that CCA is a time for them to explore their interests and to pick up new skills. Through my CCA, I’ve learnt how important teamwork is. Victory can never depend on just one player; and the whole team must work together to achieve success.

<p style="text-align:center;">My experience at YCKPS has been very rich. My defining moment was watching our school’s YCKPS Got Talent contest where my fellow schoolmates showcased a wide range of talents. It made me realise that as a student, it is not just about studying; I can learn more skills and contribute in different ways. I love being in the Student Leadership team as everyone is respectful and encouraging towards each other. As the Head Prefect, I help train the prefects for morning assembly commands and announcements and introduced a suggestion box that collects feedback from students on how we can improve their school experience. I also lead the other prefects by seeking their opinions and making sure they are heard. My motto is; if anything goes wrong in your life, always ask friends or trusted adults to help you. Everyone in YCKPS will help one another - like a family!</p>
