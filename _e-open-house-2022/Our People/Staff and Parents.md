<p style="text-align:center;">One fundamental value that we wish to develop in all YCKPS students is grit. Learning is a lifelong journey so we want our students to develop the resilience to overcome whatever challenges they may face in the process of learning. They must be adaptable and develop the relevant skills and competencies in the new future. My vision of a YCKPS student after six years in the school would be a confident person who maximises his or her strengths. The school will provide the opportunities and platforms for our students by providing them with a myriad of learning experiences. We will continually strive to provide the best for our students, to cultivate the seeds of learning in them and most importantly, igniting the spark in them to discover, develop and deepen their learning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">When I started my journey as a newly appointed School Leader in Dec 2019, I was filled with a lot of aspirations and ideas. However with COVID -19, things took a different turn and days were filled with data collection and submission. A positive outcome through these events was the bonds I have forged with parents as I worked with them hand in hand. In the last few months, my relationships with parents have strengthened and I am able to garner their support for the school. I now have an intimate knowledge of which child has a sibling in which class and what their parents do for a living. What I enjoy most in my current capacity is the time I get to spend with the students, getting to know them as individuals. I love listening to their account of their day in school and what they like and look forward to.</p>

<h6 style="color:black" align="center"> Lower Primary Teacher<br>Learning Support Coordinator</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">In order to create a safe learning environment for my students, I impart and incorporate the school values, such as respect and care, in my daily teaching. By doing so, my students are encouraged to share their ideas and take risks. They are also not fearful of asking questions and making mistakes. They understand that making mistakes is part of learning. Hence, they are not afraid to keep trying.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Taking on a new role in the Student Development Team, I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to work with a wider range of students from diverse backgrounds. Our work is not just about supporting our students academically, but also in other aspects such as the social and emotional domain and character and citizenship education. I hope that all our students will continue to learn earnestly throughout their lives and develop competencies that will serve them well in the future.</p>

<h6 style="color:black" align="center">Malay Language Teacher</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">10 years being in the service has given me the opportunity to witness the power of education; the way it uplifts and nurtures, inspires and empowers our students. It is, I believe, the single most important influence on the future of humanity. To be a teacher is to hold that future in your hands. As teachers, we do not just teach content—we teach children. They are at the center of everything we do as teachers, and every day is a new opportunity to make sure they feel valued and uplifted. In order to influence what students know, we must first understand and nurture who they are. Students must know that we care, and that we value the interests and backgrounds they bring to the table.</p>

<h6 style="color:black" align="center">Assitant Year Head / Primary 1</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">“Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education.” - Martin Luther King, Jr. I consciously build good character by using teachable moments to allow students to internalise our school values. I share my personal experiences and provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes. To support the different strengths and interests of my students, I empower them by creating a self- directed learning environment in my classroom. I provide the students with a range of learning activities and trust them to take ownership of their own learning. I gradually equip my young learners with the skills and routines required to be confident independent learners. As an Assistant Year Head (AYH), I spend time understanding and advocating for the needs of my level students. I see my role as a bridge that connects the school, teachers, parents and external partners together for the well being of the child. My favourite part of the day is pre-assembly and recess when I get to listen to students’ stories and hear their concerns. This enables me to better support them.</p>

<h6 style="color:black" align="center">English and Mathematics Teacher</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">As an English and Mathematics teacher, I often seek new and creative methodologies to spark the joy of learning in my students. Students are encouraged to share their views, experiences and ideas, to create a learning environment where students learn from each other regardless of their ability or knowledge. Apart from teaching the contents of the syllabus, I believe that it is also important to nurture my students to be individuals of great character – students who will grow up and continue to uphold the school values of care, respect, responsibility, integrity, resilience and excellence.

<h6 style="color:black" align="center"> Head Prefect<br> Excellence 2</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">My experience at YCKPS has been very rich. My defining moment was watching our school’s YCKPS Got Talent contest where my fellow schoolmates showcased a wide range of talents. It made me realise that as a student, it is not just about studying; I can learn more skills and contribute in different ways. I love being in the Student Leadership team as everyone is respectful and encouraging towards each other. As the Head Prefect, I help train the prefects for morning assembly commands and announcements and introduced a suggestion box that collects feedback from students on how we can improve their school experience. I also lead the other prefects by seeking their opinions and making sure they are heard. My motto is; if anything goes wrong in your life, always ask friends or trusted adults to help you. Everyone in YCKPS will help one another - like a family!</p>

<h6 style="color:black" align="center"> Excellence 2</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;">I was at a school in China before coming to YCKPS. When I first came here, I was very surprised as there were so many differences between YCKPS and my previous school. However, I was able to record my feelings about these differences in an art journal that my art teacher encouraged me to draw in every day. I became better at drawing because of this and I also made many friends who enjoyed drawing like me.</p>
