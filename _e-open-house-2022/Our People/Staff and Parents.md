<p style="text-align:center;">One fundamental value that we wish to develop in all YCKPS students is grit. Learning is a lifelong journey so we want our students to develop the resilience to overcome whatever challenges they may face in the process of learning. They must be adaptable and develop the relevant skills and competencies in the new future. My vision of a YCKPS student after six years in the school would be a confident person who maximises his or her strengths. The school will provide the opportunities and platforms for our students by providing them with a myriad of learning experiences. We will continually strive to provide the best for our students, to cultivate the seeds of learning in them and most importantly, igniting the spark in them to discover, develop and deepen their learning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">When I started my journey as a newly appointed School Leader in Dec 2019, I was filled with a lot of aspirations and ideas. However with COVID -19, things took a different turn and days were filled with data collection and submission. A positive outcome through these events was the bonds I have forged with parents as I worked with them hand in hand. In the last few months, my relationships with parents have strengthened and I am able to garner their support for the school. I now have an intimate knowledge of which child has a sibling in which class and what their parents do for a living. What I enjoy most in my current capacity is the time I get to spend with the students, getting to know them as individuals. I love listening to their account of their day in school and what they like and look forward to.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy using my iPad for lessons as my teachers create fun activities for us. My favourite activity is Time to Climb on Nearpod because I get to challenge my friends and it is a fun way to revise what I had learnt. It is also easier to do group activities with my friends using my iPad. We get to create mind-maps and word clouds, and I like that because we can see what everyone’s responses.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">During my P2 PAL lessons, I created a robot with my group mates. We had to win games in order to earn fake money, which we could then use to buy items to build a robot. My group bought many toilet paper rolls to build our robot. I had a lot of fun because I liked working together with my classmates and we learnt how to work together well and not fight with one another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I enjoy being an Eco Monitor because I get to encourage friends to recycle and to do so correctly, such as putting the recyclables into the correct bins. I also like designing posters to spread the recycling message and to promote recycling efforts. When we first started as Eco Monitors, we attended a training course where the teachers taught us how to become confident leaders. I feel that being an Eco Monitor is an important role because I lead by example and guide my schoolmates to be more environmentally responsible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I like to dance at home, so I decided to join the Malay Dance CCA. I will sometimes even sing along as I dance! I get along very well with the other Malay Dance members, and we always have a good time talking and practising our routines during CCA sessions. One thing I am proud of is our preparation for this year’s Hari Raya virtual concert. Due to Covid-19 safe management measures, we could not perform “live”. However, my friends and I managed to celebrate Hari Raya with the whole school through a recorded performance. It was very fun and we even got to choose our own costumes! I would definitely recommend my juniors to join the Malay Dance CCA as they will create great memories!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I have been interested in football since I was in Primary 1. I especially admire Christiano Ronaldo. I love playing in football matches with friends; we get to appreciate each others’ unique skills. The most memorable experience was when out team won a soccer competition this year! During Foootball CCA sessions, we practise out positioning and ball footwork, and time passes by so quickly because we all have so much fun! I would like to tell my juniors that CCA is a time for them to explore their interests and to pick up new skills. Through my CCA, I’ve learnt how important teamwork is. Victory can never depend on just one player; and the whole team must work together to achieve success.

<p style="text-align:center;">My experience at YCKPS has been very rich. My defining moment was watching our school’s YCKPS Got Talent contest where my fellow schoolmates showcased a wide range of talents. It made me realise that as a student, it is not just about studying; I can learn more skills and contribute in different ways. I love being in the Student Leadership team as everyone is respectful and encouraging towards each other. As the Head Prefect, I help train the prefects for morning assembly commands and announcements and introduced a suggestion box that collects feedback from students on how we can improve their school experience. I also lead the other prefects by seeking their opinions and making sure they are heard. My motto is; if anything goes wrong in your life, always ask friends or trusted adults to help you. Everyone in YCKPS will help one another - like a family!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I was at a school in China before coming to YCKPS. When I first came here, I was very surprised as there were so many differences between YCKPS and my previous school. However, I was able to record my feelings about these differences in an art journal that my art teacher encouraged me to draw in every day. I became better at drawing because of this and I also made many friends who enjoyed drawing like me.</p>
