ðŸ“£ A shoutout to all the ex-students of YCKPS!

**Homecoming is here again!** This year, it will be held on 31 August 2023, Thursday, from 11.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., at our school canteen.

Come visit us and catch up with your ex-teachers and old friends to reminisce the fond memories of your primary school years. Take some time to have a picture together or pen a note of appreciation to your former teachers during the event.

You may register for the event by scanning the QR code or via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/yckhomecoming3108](https://go.gov.sg/yckhomecoming3108?fbclid=IwAR3RJXSej0MUUz1MOO5OtdL9zrg09iqWuev9DZ1iJv8byrmBHXYvErWKa-8). Please note that there is another link at the end of the form for you to write a note of appreciation for your ex-teachers.

Thank you and we look forward to seeing you on 31 August 2023!
