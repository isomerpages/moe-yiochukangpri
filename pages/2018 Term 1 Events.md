#### **Lab On Wheels**  

On 18th and 19th January 2018, our P4 and P5 students went on board a tech bus titled 'Lab On Wheels' to experience a programming workshop entitled 'Robot Rattle'.

Students learnt programming concepts and logic to activate an online robot. The online robot was able to complete various tasks, including pushing a ball, picking up a box and loading the boxes onto a container.

The workshop allowed the students to develop logical thinking and problem solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes. Students also worked in pairs and learned through peer-learning.

#### **Chinese New Year Celebration**   

The 2018 Chinese New Year Celebration was organized successfully!

The Chinese New Year concert started with Principal’s speech which reminded students to be grateful for the peaceful and prosperous life now in Singapore and to treasure the time with family members and appreciate what we have.

Students then went on to watch the Chinese New Year well wishes video in which Vice Principals and teachers wish each and every one a joyous New Year celebration. Students also watched in awe as our Chinese Dance members performed.

Parents and teachers were invited to come together to do a calligraphy of “大地回春”. Students enjoyed the beautiful calligraphy work done by teachers and parents.

We then gave out the Best Decorated Classroom award for each level. Students felt proud of their own effort and everyone cheered for each other when the class won the Best Decorated Classroom award for Chinese New Year.

We ended with a bang with the Lion Dance performance. This was the finale which livened up the entire atmosphere!

This year for the Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration, each classroom was decorated based on the theme: Chinese New Year Customs and Traditions. Through this competition, we hope that our students gain more knowledge about the Chinese culture and the traditions and practices, through the fun and bonding process of decorating the classroom.
