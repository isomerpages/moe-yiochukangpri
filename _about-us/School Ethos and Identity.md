The lyrics of the School Song were written by the Principal of the School, Mr. S. Ratnagopal in July 1970.

  

We are happy boys and girls at school

Our days with knowledge bright and full

To work, to serve without a sigh

E'er we maintain our standards high.

  

**Chorus**

Yio Chu Kang our very own

The seeds of learning here are sown

We're youths of character keen to serve

The name of our school we'll ever preserve.

  

Our Yio Chu Kang School forever

Success in our endeavour

Onwards, upward we will strive

To serve our Singapore with pride
