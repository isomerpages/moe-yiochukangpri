Belongings
----------

Parents should help to ensure that children's belongings (such as school bag, uniform, jacket, water bottle, food container and books) have their names and classes written or pasted on them.  
  
It would also be helpful to remind children not to leave their belongings lying around. Children can be taught to keep things in their proper places.  
  

Valuables
---------

Students are not allowed to wear jewellery (eg chain, bracelet, ring) or other valuables to school. Wrist watches should be kept simple with basic functions.  
  

Pocket Money
------------

Food prices in the canteen are kept low. Parents are advised to give only a reasonable amount as pocket money. Healthy Eating Bento set options are sold at every food stall.  
Water coolers are available for students to get free cold water.
