Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on environmental science (ESTEM@YCKPS) aims to expose our students to environmental issues affecting our world and the science and technology of sustainability. Key to the ALP is the Environmental Project Work (EPW), where we want to develop our Primary 4 to 6 students through a problem-based approach to learn how to solve real-life environmental issues. Our teachers designed this integrated project work, closely tying it to science and other curriculum subjects, to bring the joy of learning beyond the classroom to our students.

Our Life-Long Learning Programme (LLP) on visual and performing arts (CREATE@YCKPS)  aims to develop a greater awareness and appreciation of the arts in our students. Through a structured and comprehensive 6-year Art and Music Modular programme, our students are exposed to a diverse range of art and music genres. Supported by the performing arts CCAs in the school, we aim to develop our students to become effective communicators who can express themselves confidently.

Character development of our students remains an important area of focus for the school. As Martin Luther Jr once said, “Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education.”  The school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme comprises the Values Express Programme, Values in Action (VIA), Integrated Learning Trails and the annual NE commemorative events. The school’s 6-year progressive CCE programme serves to develop value-centred students who know and love Singapore. We also aim to nurture our students into caring and concerned citizens who actively improve the lives of others around them.

We believe in building a conducive environment for our teachers to teach and for our students to learn. We want to create a green oasis for our students. We want to inculcate an appreciation for nature and the importance of biodiversity in our students, especially in a concrete jungle like Singapore. We want to create a good learning environment and provide varied learning opportunities so that every child under our care can grow and learn well.
  
  
Yours in education,
