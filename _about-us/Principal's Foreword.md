<p>Greetings in the year 2025! This is a very special year for Yio Chu Kang
Primary School (YCKPS). Not only are we celebrating SG60 in 2025, this
year also marks the diamond jubilee year for YCKPS as she will be celebrating
her 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary as an educational institution that has journeyed
to develop generations of students over her 75 founding years.</p>
<p>In YCKPS, we strongly believe the importance of developing our students
holistically through the ‘head’, ‘heart’ and ‘hands’ as espoused by our
school’s vision, <strong>‘Empowering Minds, Engaging Hearts and Extending Hands’</strong> which
has recently updated for 2025 onwards to pluralise the words ‘Minds’ and
‘Hearts’ to emphasise the importance of impacting every student’s learning
and development in YCKPS.</p>
<p>Apart from building a strong foundation in students’ literacy and numeracy
skills, our focus in YCKPS is to provide a school experience to develop
every child into a confident, adaptable and resilient student, ready for
secondary school when he/she graduates in Primary Six. This includes opportunities
for students to engage in exploration and co-construction of ideas with
peers facilitated by teachers; meaningful creation of learning artefacts;
and effective communication with peers and teachers. Importantly, students
should discover their strengths, passion and interest through the course
of learning. Through the school experience, students derive the motivation
to learn and value the importance of pursuing life-long learning.</p>
<p>The total developmental curriculum in YCKPS also encompasses our signature
programmes, namely our Applied Learning Programme (eSTEM@YCKPS) and our
Learning for Life Programme (CREATE@YCKPS). <strong>eSTEM@YCKPS</strong> integrates
environmental and sustainability concepts into the learning of Science,
Technology, Environment and Mathematics, thus creating a greater appreciation
of how the learning through STEM can be translated into an impactful appreciation
of and positive act on the environment as well as life in context. &nbsp;<strong>CREATE@YCKPS</strong> provides
students with a contrasting developmental experience to benefit from arts
education; appreciation of the arts; inculcation of strong values; development
of social and emotional competencies; and translation of learnt skills
to contribute to the community.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the curricular experience will continue to be progressively
tweaked to facilitate the learning and development of the emerging 21 century
competencies (e21CC) of our students which is key in student development.
This year, YCKPS has embarked on EdTech 2030 which sees stronger integration
of educational technology into the learning and developmental experiences
for our YCKPS students.</p>
<p>Above all, aligned with the school’s motto, “<strong>Y</strong>outh of <strong>C</strong>haracter, <strong>K</strong>een
to <strong>S</strong>erve”, strong values remain critical and will be inculcated
through the learning experience for students to develop good character
and a strong sense of mission to serve actively in school and in adulthood
as citizens of our nation. Interestingly, the first letter that made up
the words in the school’s motto form the acronym “YCKS” which represents
‘Yio Chu Kang School’ of which YCKPS and her motto first originated from
in 1950 when the school was first founded and situated along Yio Chu Kang
Road. We also look forward to hearing from our alumni and ex-staff of YCKPS
or YCKS in this 75<sup>th</sup> Diamond Jubilee celebratory year and would
like to re-connect with you.</p>
<p>As we journey into this new season as a school community, we look forward
to working in synergistic partnership with our parents and key stakeholders
as we move forward in tandem to develop our YCKPS students holistically!
Together, let’s raise a happy, confident and kind generation of students!</p>
