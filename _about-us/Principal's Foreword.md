<p>In 2025, Yio Chu Kang Primary School (YCKPS) celebrated her 75<sup>th</sup> Founding
Year. It was a warm and ‘homely’ celebration for students, staff and key
stakeholders including our School Advisory Committee, parents and alumnus
to reflect on YCKPS’ journey in developing generations of students over
her 75 founding years. At the same time, YCKPS community looks forward
to forging the future together to provide a holistic and progressive developmental
experience for every student. As we venture into 2026, we look forward
to continue strengthening the holistic development of our YCKPS students
through the ‘head’, ‘heart’ and ‘hands’ domains as espoused by our school’s
vision, <strong>‘Empowering Minds, Engaging Hearts and Extending Hands’</strong>.</p>
<p>While we recognize that building a strong foundation in students’ literacy
and numeracy skills remains key in primary school education, YCKPS is also
focused on providing <strong>greater customization of learning and developmental experience</strong> for
our students based on their developmental readiness and needs. This comprises
school experiences for students to engage in exploration and co-construction
of ideas with peers to problem solve; critical thinking and inventive thinking;
and effective and respectful communication with peers and teachers. All
these are aligned with the YCKPS’ exploration into the development of ‘Emerging
21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies’ (e21CC) in 2026 as part of her journey
into the ‘Future of Learning’ while the seamless integration of EdTech
implemented since 2025 will continue to be deepened as part of the learning
experience of students. Importantly, students should continue to discover
their strengths, passion and interest through the course of learning, facilitated
by their teachers. Through the school experience, students derive the motivation
to learn and value the importance of pursuing life-long learning as a life
skill.</p>
<p>The total developmental curriculum in YCKPS also encompasses our signature
programmes, namely our Applied Learning Programme (STEM@YCKPS) and our
Learning for Life Programme (CREATE@YCKPS). <strong>STEM@YCKPS</strong> integrates
concepts in Science, Technology, Environment and Mathematics as part of
the learning, typically experienced through non-routine and open-ended
learning tasks, thus creating a greater appreciation of how the learning
through STEM can be translated into real-life contexts. &nbsp;<strong>CREATE@YCKPS</strong> provides
students with a contrasting developmental experience to benefit from arts
education; appreciation of the arts; inculcation of strong values; development
of social and emotional competencies; and translation of learnt skills
to contribute to the community.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, aligned with the school’s motto, “<strong>Y</strong>outh
of <strong>C</strong>haracter, <strong>K</strong>een to <strong>S</strong>erve”,
strong values remain critical and will be inculcated through the learning
experience for students to develop good character and a strong sense of
mission to serve actively in school and in adulthood as citizens of our
nation.</p>
<p>As we journey into this new season as a school community, we look forward
to working in synergistic partnership with our parents and key stakeholders
as we move forward in tandem to develop our YCKPS students holistically!
Together, let’s raise a happy, confident and kind generation of students!</p>
