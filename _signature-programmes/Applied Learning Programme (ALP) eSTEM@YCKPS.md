<p><strong>E<em>STEM@YCKPS â€“ Nurturing Eco-Stewards of Tomorrow</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At Yio Chu Kang Primary School, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is
rooted in <strong>Environmental STEM (ESTEM)</strong> â€” a vibrant and purposeful
integration of environmental education and STEM learning. We believe that
environmental education is more than just a subject; it is a call to action.
It is essential for raising awareness, fostering responsible behavior,
and equipping our students with the skills and mindset to tackle environmental
challenges.</p>
<p>By embedding sustainability into our curriculum, we aim to cultivate eco-conscious
learners who actively contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Our 3-Tier ACE Approach: ESTEM@YCKPS</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture our young environmental stewards, we employ a structured ACE
approach:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;ðŸŒ± A â€“ Awareness about the Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>Our programmes promote environmental awareness, helping students understand
the impact of human behavior on Earth. Through activities such as recycling
projects, commemorating environmental events, assembly programmes and interactive
recess engagement, students develop a deep appreciation for nature and
the need for sustainable practices. With increased awareness, we become
more conscious of how our actions affect the planet and are more likely
to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors.</p>

<p>We commemorated Earth Day with a sea of blue and green outfits worn by
students and teachers. The day started with assembly talk from Plastify
sharing with students innovative methods to transform waste into practical
materials. Through hands-on demonstration, students had the opportunity
to grasp the recycling process of plastic and experience turning plastic
shards into recycled products such as carabiners and coasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ðŸŒ¿ C â€“ Connecting with the Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that meaningful experiences in nature cultivate a sense of
ownership and responsibility. Through hands-on activities like planting
and harvesting plants in our very own hydroponics farm, learning journeys,
and ESTEM Project work, students build a personal relationship with the
natural world. These experiences allow students to forge meaningful connections
with the environment, fostering a sense of responsibility and care for
the world around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By developing a <strong>strong connection with the environment</strong>,
we nurture empathy for nature and inspire action. We hope to encourage
students to take responsibility for the environment and to engage in sustainable
behaviors that protect and preserve natural ecosystems.</p>

<p><strong>E-Stem Project Work</strong> for Primary Three to Six students
is one of the signature programme designed to create experiences for students
to connect with the environment and to understand real-world environmental
issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The school aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>encourage students to appreciate the environment and be&nbsp;<strong>aware</strong>&nbsp;of
the need to take care of it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>present learning opportunities for students to co-construct their understanding
of real-world problems through&nbsp;<strong>connecting</strong>&nbsp;with
the environment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide opportunities to&nbsp;<strong>extend</strong>&nbsp;studentsâ€™ learning
about the environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>YCKPS strives to achieve the following outcomes in our students through
the&nbsp;ESTEM@YCKPS:</p>
<p>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Confident Persons</strong>&nbsp;who
knows their strengths and areas of growth, and can express themselves confidently.</p>
<p>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Self-Directed Learners</strong>&nbsp;who
are able to think for themselves and take pride in their work.</p>
<p>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Active Contributors</strong>&nbsp;who
have a lively curiosity about things and the ability to cooperate, share
and care for others.</p>
<p>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Concerned Citizens</strong>&nbsp;who
know and love Singapore.</p>
<p>A three-tier approach is deployed:</p>

<p>Additionally, the school commemorated the Earth Day where all the lights
and fans in the classrooms were switched off to signify the schoolâ€™s commitment
to saving Mother Earth. Students also visited display booths from NEA and
reflected on what they had learnt during this day.</p>

<h2>Tier 2: Connecting with the Environment</h2>
<p>Students took part in programmes where they gained exposure to the use
of technology in various platforms. They also&nbsp;learnt basic programming
and computational thinking skills as part of the schoolâ€™s effort to prepare
the students for the future through our ALP.</p>
<p><strong>P4&nbsp;EPW â€“ Letâ€™s Go Green</strong>
</p>
<p>The P4 EPW is on urban greening.&nbsp;The students explored and learnt
about the positive impact of greenery on our environment. The lesson package
was crafted based on the Five Handy Thinking Tools and Cooperative Learning
Strategies, and was infused with impactful&nbsp;Making Thinking Visible
(MTV)&nbsp;routines. On top of that, a Code for Fun workshop was incorporated
in this&nbsp;EPW where our students learnt basic programming and computational
thinking skills as they infused the use of micro:bits in hydroponics&nbsp;or
in designing a smart home.</p>

<p><strong>P5 EPW - Every Drop Counts</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5&nbsp;EPW is on water conservation. In addition to the learning
in school, the students went to the NEWater Visitor Centre to find out
more about one of Singaporeâ€™s national taps. Furthermore, the students
collaborated in teams and created their own artefacts. They showcased their
final products and educated the audiences on the importance of conserving
water during the VIA Exposition week.</p>
