\*STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics

  

ESTEM@YCKPS is the school’s signature programme utilising a problem-based learning approach which leverages science, and integrating with other disciplines, for students to learn more about environment and sustainable living. Students will develop the necessary skills and values for the 21st&nbsp;century through this programme.

  

The school aims to:

*   encourage students to appreciate the environment and be&nbsp;**aware**&nbsp;of the need to take care of it;
*   present learning opportunities for students to co-construct their understanding of real-world problems through&nbsp;**connecting**&nbsp;with the environment; and  
    

*   provide opportunities to&nbsp;**extend**&nbsp;students’ learning about the environment.

  

YCKPS strives to achieve the following outcomes in our students through the&nbsp;ESTEM@YCKPS:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Confident Persons**&nbsp;who knows their strengths and areas of growth, and can express themselves confidently.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Self-Directed Learners**&nbsp;who are able to think for themselves and take pride in their work.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Active Contributors**&nbsp;who have a lively curiosity about things and the ability to cooperate, share and care for others.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Concerned Citizens**&nbsp;who know and love Singapore.

  

A three-tier approach is deployed:

Tier 1: Awareness about the Environment
---------------------------------------

Assembly talks were held to create awareness on the environmental issues we faced.

Additionally, the school commemorated the Earth Day where all the lights and fans in the classrooms were switched off to signify the school’s commitment to saving Mother Earth. Students also visited display booths from NEA and reflected on what they had learnt during this day.

Tier 2: Connecting with the Environment
---------------------------------------

Students took part in programmes where they gained exposure to the use of technology in various platforms. They also&nbsp;learnt basic programming and computational thinking skills as part of the school’s effort to prepare the students for the future through our ALP.

  

**P4&nbsp;EPW – Let’s Go Green**

The P4 EPW is on urban greening.&nbsp;The students explored and learnt about the positive impact of greenery on our environment. The lesson package was crafted based on the Five Handy Thinking Tools and Cooperative Learning Strategies, and was infused with impactful&nbsp;Making Thinking Visible (MTV)&nbsp;routines. On top of that, a Code for Fun workshop was incorporated in this&nbsp;EPW where our students learnt basic programming and computational thinking skills as they infused the use of micro:bits in hydroponics&nbsp;or in designing a smart home.

**P5 EPW - Every Drop Counts**

The P5&nbsp;EPW is on water conservation. In addition to the learning in school, the students went to the NEWater Visitor Centre to find out more about one of Singapore’s national taps. Furthermore, the students collaborated in teams and created their own artefacts. They showcased their final products and educated the audiences on the importance of conserving water during the VIA Exposition week.

**P6&nbsp;EPW – Save the Earth**

The P6 EPW is on global warming. Issues relating to the conservation of the environment and Man’s impact on the environment are being discussed in the P6&nbsp;EPW. Similar to the other&nbsp;EPWs, students co-constructed their knowledge and skills with their peers. The P6 students collaborated in groups to present what they have learnt.

\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of their graduation, the P6 students shared their reflections about environmental issues through Art and their art pieces were put up for exhibition in school.

Tier 3: Extending the Learning about the Environment
----------------------------------------------------

For students with greater interest and aptitude, they can participate in additional activities or competitions to enhance their experiences and extend their learning about the environment.
