An LLP in the Arts typically includes activities that involve self-discovery, character-building, honing of values, development of social-emotional skills and life skills.

ABOUT CREATE@YCKPS

* **Self-Directed and Engaged Learners** who enjoy learning, have a lively curiosity about things and take ownership of their learning. **
*  **Active Contributors** who collaborate effectively with others, share and care for others and strives for excellence.

#### **Tier 1 - Exposure to the Arts (School-wide Programmes)**  

Tier 1 school-wide **Exposure** programmes for all our students across Primary 1 to 6 aim to create awareness and appreciation of the Arts.

**Termly Aesthetics Assembly**

For one Assembly each term, the LLP team organizes a special Aesthetics Assembly programme to expose our students to different forms of visual and performing arts. The main aims of these programmes are to expose our students to a variety of artforms and to allow them to learn from professional artists and musicians. At the same time, these programmes help our students make connections between their learning of Art and Music in the classroom to authentic contexts in the real world.

**Aesthetics Week**

Aesthetics Week is a regular feature in the school calendar with special Arts events and activities organized for one week of the school year. Each year, a different theme is chosen to give students the opportunity to see how the Arts can relate to different aspects of their lives. The wide range of fun and engaging activities expose our students to different art forms and artistic experiences.

In 2024, we collaborated with the Applied Learning Programme team to organise an Earth-day themed Aesthetics Week with the theme of ‘**Saving Our World**’. The week-long celebration kicked off with a whole school dress up; the fun continued during recess with a Pledge Tree, Music Boards, origami stations, an exhibition from NParks, a photography exhibition and an informative presentation about endangered animals. In addition, our Art and Music Lessons for the week encouraged our students to exercise their creativity while emphasizing sustainability. The activities gave our students a chance to explore a wide variety of environmental topics and also helped them think of creative approaches to reuse, reduce and recycle.

**Art Space**

Launched in 2024, the YCKPS Art Space is a new learning space in the school which serves to extend our students’ learning of Art outside the classroom. With the installation of two Art TVs, the Art Space serves to digitally showcase our students’ artworks completed in their Art classrooms. This not only allows our students to view their artworks on display, they also get the chance to appreciate artworks created by their peers from all classes and all levels.

**External Performances**

In recent years, students who are interested in the Performing Arts have attended concerts held at external venues. They have watched performances put up by the Singapore National Youth Orchestra and the Singapore National Youth Chinese Orchestra whereby many of the performers are also students like themselves. These are eye-opening experiences which inspires our students to discover and share their own talents and passion.

**Enrichment Programmes for Members of Arts CCAs**

To provide our interested students with greater exposure and experiences, members of the Performing Arts CCA groups also view public performances at external venues. Similarly, members of Visual Arts Club view artworks exhibited by other schools and at museums. Members of Arts CCAs are also given opportunities to interact with professional art practitioners in authentic settings such as dance studios and art studios. This allows them to learn from observation of others, as part of their journey of self-discovery so that they can improve on their own skills and techniques.
