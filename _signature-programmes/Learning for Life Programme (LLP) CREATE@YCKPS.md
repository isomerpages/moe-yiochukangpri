What is LLP?
------------

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) exposes students to a wide range of experiences to build their social-emotional competencies and to acquire sound values. An LLP in the Arts typically includes activities that involve self-discovery, character-building, honing of values, development of social-emotional skills and life skills.

ABOUT CREATE@YCKPS
------------

CREATE@YCKPS, our school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), harnesses the benefits of Arts education to inculcate strong values and social emotional learning in our students, preparing them to meet the challenges of the future. Leveraging on the Arts, the school aims to achieve the following **outcomes** in our students:   
* **Confident Persons** who know their strengths, are confident and effective communicators who are able to express themselves confidently.
* **Self-Directed and Engaged Learners** who enjoy learning, have a lively curiosity about things and take ownership of their learning. **
*  **Active Contributors** who collaborate effectively with others, share and care for others and strives for excellence. 
*  **Concerned Citizens** who take an active role in bettering the lives of others around them.

The 3-tier framework below summarises the CREATE@YCKPS programme:

#### **Tier 1 - Exposure to the Arts (School-wide Programmes)**  

Tier 1 school-wide **Exposure** programmes for all our students across Primary 1 to 6 aim to create awareness and appreciation of the Arts.

**Termly Aesthetics Assembly**

For one Assembly each term, the LLP team organizes a special Aesthetics Assembly programme to expose our students to different forms of visual and performing arts. The main aims of these programmes are to expose our students to a variety of artforms and to allow them to learn from professional artists and musicians. At the same time, these programmes help our students make connections between their learning of Art and Music in the classroom to authentic contexts in the real world.

**Aesthetics Week**

Aesthetics Week is a regular feature in the school calendar with special Arts events and activities organized for one week of the school year. Each year, a different theme is chosen to give students the opportunity to see how the Arts can relate to different aspects of their lives. The wide range of fun and engaging activities expose our students to different art forms and artistic experiences.

In 2024, we collaborated with the Applied Learning Programme team to organise an Earth-day themed Aesthetics Week with the theme of ‘**Saving Our World**’. The week-long celebration kicked off with a whole school dress up; the fun continued during recess with a Pledge Tree, Music Boards, origami stations, an exhibition from NParks, a photography exhibition and an informative presentation about endangered animals. In addition, our Art and Music Lessons for the week encouraged our students to exercise their creativity while emphasizing sustainability. The activities gave our students a chance to explore a wide variety of environmental topics and also helped them think of creative approaches to reuse, reduce and recycle.

**Art Space**

Launched in 2024, the YCKPS Art Space is a new learning space in the school which serves to extend our students’ learning of Art outside the classroom. With the installation of two Art TVs, the Art Space serves to digitally showcase our students’ artworks completed in their Art classrooms. This not only allows our students to view their artworks on display, they also get the chance to appreciate artworks created by their peers from all classes and all levels.

**Tuesday Busking**

&nbsp;In 2019, the school introduced a more frequent busking platform where students of all classes share with the students&nbsp;masses their musical and dance skills during recess. Students feel proud to showcase their skills and talents and student audience&nbsp;**practice performance etiquette and appreciation**&nbsp;while watching these busking performances.&nbsp;_(Busking is suspended due to COVID-19)_

**Theatre Experience Programme**  

All our Primary 3 students go on a learning journey to experience viewing a performance at an external professional venue. They learn to&nbsp;**appreciate the performance while practising theatre etiquette and learning values**&nbsp;through the performances. Although we were not able to bring students out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed to continue the programme with a digital performance for a virtual theatre experience!

**Museum Education Programme&nbsp;**

The key outcome for Museum Education Programme is for our students to experience integrated learning of Art, English and Social Studies through their interaction with museum artefacts in a museum setting. Prior to 2020, Primary 2 students would go to the Philatelic Museum and Primary 5 students would go to Asian Civilisation Museum to&nbsp;**discover new learning and make connections**&nbsp;to what they have learnt in class.

**Primary 6 Graduation Art Exhibition**

At the end of each year, Primary 6 students put up a Graduation Art Exhibition to showcase the culmination of our students’ art education journey after six years of primary school life. Each student would have&nbsp;**developed sound social emotional skills, life skills and artistic skills to be able to create such meaningful Art.**&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 2021, the theme for the Graduation Art Exhibition was Time. Students ideate and create works of art that show the past, present and future. There is also an e-Exhibition to allow for greater access to the Exhibition and for more students’ works to be displayed.

**Aesthetics Week**

Aesthetics Week is a regular feature in the school calendar with special Arts events and activities organized to expose our students to different art forms and artistic experiences.

In 2021, the theme of Aesthetics Week was ‘**Loving our World**’. The Music teachers shared songs about the environment with the students while the Art teachers organized the whole school to complete a school-wide recyclable mural using bottle caps and plastic bags.&nbsp;_\[Click&nbsp;here_&nbsp;_to see how the mural was created.\]_&nbsp;The virtual finals of the YCKPS Got Talent Competition 2020/2021 allowed all our students to enjoy a range of diverse performances by their talented schoolmates.

In 2022, the theme of Aesthetics Week was ‘**Arts in Bloom**’ to encourage students to explore the Arts in our school, especially in our school garden. During Art lessons, students created abstract painting using nature and mini clay sculptures that represented nature. For Music lessons, students were introduced to ambisonic soundscapes and created their own musical compositions using sounds recorded around the school. There were also numerous fringe events, including a Photography Exhibition, Music Boards for students to play with during recess, a Virtual Art Gallery, Poetry display and even a fashion display by teachers!

#### **Tier 2 – Exploration of the Arts**

Students who are interested to explore and pursue their interest in the Arts are able to choose from seven Arts-related CCAs offered in the school, namely

(1) Handbell\
(2) Angklung\
(3) Chinese Dance\
(4) Malay Dance\
(5) Indian Dance\
(6) Choir\
(7) Visual Art Club

Students of these CCAs have the opportunity to deepen their learning, involvement and exposure in the Arts, enabling them to&nbsp;**develop skills and competencies**&nbsp;in their chosen area of specialisation. CCA activities also aim to inculcate values in our students, hone their social and emotional competencies, build their character and help them forge friendships with students of diverse backgrounds.

**Community Engagement through the Arts**

Our Tier 2 programmes also give our students the opportunity to use their artistic talents and skills to engagement with the community. In recent years, our students have put up &nbsp;performances at Ci Yuan CC and Meranti Home during events and festive celebrations. Our students have also presented their artwork to seniors at the Jia Ying Senior Activity Centre.

**Enrichment Programmes for Members of Arts CCAs**

To provide our interested students with greater exposure and experiences, members of the Performing Arts CCA groups also view public performances at external venues. Similarly, members of Visual Arts Club view artworks exhibited by other schools and at museums. Members of Arts CCAs are also given opportunities to interact with professional art practitioners in authentic settings such as dance studios and art studios. This allows them to learn from observation of others,&nbsp;**as part of their journey of self-discovery**&nbsp;so that they can improve on their own skills and techniques.&nbsp;

#### **Tier 3 – Excellence in the Arts**

Students with strong passion and relevant dispositions in the arts will platforms to further develop and refine their skills. They will be encouraged to strive for excellence in the Arts through external performances (such as the school musical), exhibitions in collaboration with external agencies and competitions.

Students not only polish their artistic skills in these months of preparation. The preparation process teaches students resilience, self and social awareness, self-management and care for self and others. Students further develop leadership and life skills throughout this unique learning platform and grow into a more independent and reliable individual. In 2017, the school put up Disney’s&nbsp;_Mulan The Musical_&nbsp;at Agape Concert Hall, which involved 50 students in the cast and 103 students from Performing Arts groups.![](/images/LLP24.png)
