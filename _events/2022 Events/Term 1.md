**P4 Personal Learning Device (PLD) Handover for PDLP Pilot**  
  

As part of MOE’s Personal Learning Device Programme (PDLP) Pilot for Primary Schools, our Primary 4 students received their personal learning devices (PLDs) and were successfully onboarded the Device Management Application (DMA) in February 2022. During the handover exercise, the Form Teachers guided the students through the new routines, mobile learning rules and the DMA onboarding process. All the students have taken a pledge to use the devices meaningfully and responsibly in both face to face and digital environment. The students will use their PLDs starting Week 7 to support their learning in school. Our teachers will work closely with MOE HQ to design learning experiences for students to acquire digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information online. Our students will also eventually bring their PLDs home in the near future to support their learning from home. We look forward to partner our P4 parents to guide their child adopt healthy habits when using the PLDs outside of school and to place limits, as necessary, at home.

**P3 Theatre Experience 2022**

Although we still cannot bring our Primary 3 students out to watch a live theatre performance due to the pandemic, we managed to organise a performance by Morph Theatre for our students through digital means on 10 Feb 2022. The students watched the Japanese story “**_Crow Boy_**” about a boy who was bullied by his classmates in school and often spent his free time alone. A teacher recognised his talents and helped him to gain acceptance by others.  The teachers made use of the performance to reinforce the students’ learning of the **_STAGE_** **_Framework_** (**_S_**_tance_, **_T_**_one_, **_A_**_rticulation_, **_G_**_estures_ & **_E_**_ye_ _Contact_) – our school’s structured approach to nurturing our students to become confident and effective communicators.
