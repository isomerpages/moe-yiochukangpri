**Aesthetics Week 2022**  

This year’s Aesthetics Week was held from 18 - 22 April 2022 with the theme ‘Arts in Bloom’. The school-wide activities aimed to deepen our students’ appreciation for the Arts and encourage them to discover the Arts within the school environment.

Art and Music lessons were specially tailored according to the theme and exposed our students to various forms and mediums for creative expression. During Art lessons, students created abstract painting using natural elements and mini clay sculptures that represented nature. For Music lessons, students were introduced to ambisonic soundscapes and created their own musical compositions using sounds recorded around the school.

On top of that, fringe events such as the Photography Exhibition and Music Boards provided our students with experiential learning of the Arts in our school. To showcase our students’ achievements, there was also a Virtual Art Gallery and Poetry display around the school.

Overall, it was a memorable Aesthetics Week not only for our students but also staff members, who participated in a fashion display as they dressed up based on the theme of ‘Arts in Bloom’ on the opening day of Aesthetics Week!
