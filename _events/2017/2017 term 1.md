**Chinese New Year Celebration 2017**  
  

Our annual Chinese New Year Celebration was once again organized successfully! The students watched the performance put up by our Chinese Dance in awe; had fun during the games section; they felt proud of their own classroom when it won as the Best Decorated Classroom for CNY; last but not least, the Lion Dance performance was the finale which livened up the entire atmosphere!
