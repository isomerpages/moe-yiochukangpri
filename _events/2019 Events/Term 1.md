#### **P6 Dragon Boating Experience (10 - 11 January)**

Sun, sea and lots of sunblock! The whole P6 cohort spent a morning at Kallang Basin enjoying a fun and&nbsp;confidence building&nbsp;dragon boating activity. They&nbsp;learnt&nbsp;the importance of hard work, teamwork&nbsp;and&nbsp;unity of class spirit. The form and co-form teachers sportingly joined the class students on water and paddled in unison. After the event, the P6s reflected on how they could apply the learning experiences in their daily life.

#### **Total Defence Day (TDD) Commemoration (11 Feb 2019)**

Singapore has remained safe and peaceful over the past 53 years because of all Singaporeans’ efforts in carrying out Total Defence. It continues to be relevant because the threats we face today require everyone to come forth and play their part.

In living out the TDD theme for this year – “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, a slew of activities were organised on 11 February 2019. The activities aimed to drive across the key messages that every pupil can play his/her part in Total Defence and our collective effort is needed to keep our nation strong.

#### **P4 Traffic Games @Road Safety Community Park**

Our Primary 4 cohort went to the Road Safety Community Park on two separate days, February 27 and March 1. They spent a morning playing a different role each – marshal, pedestrian, cyclist or go-kart driver – within the confines of the Safety Park. They learnt the requirements of each role through briefings by the Traffic Police before they went to their various stations to begin the game.&nbsp;

#### **P4 Code for Fun**

The second part of our&nbsp;**_P4 EPW (Environmental Project Work)_**, the&nbsp;**_Code for Fun_**, was conducted from Monday to Thursday of Term 1 Week 10. Our students learnt basic programming and computational thinking skills as they infused the use of micro:bits in hydroponics. From their reflections, the students were able to apply the use of technology in the growing of plants.

#### **P4 EPW**

The first part of our P4 EPW, “Let’s Go Green”, has successfully concluded. Our ALP Committee spent their year-end holiday last year working on this new package for the students to explore and understand the positive impact of greenery on our environment. The lesson package was crafted based on the Five Handy Thinking Tools and Cooperative Learning Strategies, and infused with impactful MTV routines. Our students’ learning were enriched!
