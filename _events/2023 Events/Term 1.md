#### **Total Defence Day** 

Our school commemorated Total Defence in Term 1 Week 7, in remembrance of Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. We were reminded that everyone of us has an important role to play in defending our homeland in times of disruption and crisis. Focusing on the theme, “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, our students learnt during the assembly talk on Monday (13 February) the different ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives, with the focus this year on how we deal with food security issues in Singapore.

The highlight for the week was when we went through a school-wide lockdown exercise on Total Defence Day (15 February). &nbsp;The exercise reminds us that we must always be ready and prepared for any emergency situation or challenges that can hit us.

During CCE (FTGP) lessons on the same day after the exercise, our students also conducted the various TDD related lessons to learn about the roles they could play to prepare for future threats and challenges. Our students were also engaged in the various TDD activities in the Kindsville Times to further learn about how we could strengthen our resolve to keep Singapore strong.

#### **Nurture Programme**

Selected Primary 2 to Primary 4 students started their Nurture Programme on 17 February 2023. The Nurture Programme is conducted weekly in partnership with the Central Singapore CDC with the aim to develop our students as effective communicators, problem-solvers and self- directed learners. The lessons are designed to be activity-based. In the first lesson, students set Nurture class rules aligned to our school values. They were also given opportunities to share their thoughts and feelings on topics of interest. The students had a fruitful and engaging lesson, and they are looking forward to their weekly sessions with their lead teachers from the CDC and student volunteers from the Singapore Management University (SMU).

#### **P4 E2K Sessions**
<br>
As part of the Mathematics department’s efforts to nurture young Mathematical talents, a group of Primary 4 students were selected to participate in the Excellence-2000 (E2K) programme for Mathematics. Using stories, games and puzzles, students get to practise and hone their problem-solving skills, as well as develop confidence and independence in carrying out mathematical inquiry. For instance, in one of the E2K sessions, students explored and learnt various strategies to win a memory game. Through role playing and analysing different strategies put forth, students had the opportunity to construct their own strategy to win the game.
