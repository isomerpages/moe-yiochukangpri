The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES 文化随意门) is aimed at enhancing our students’ understanding and knowledge of the Chinese Language and the Chinese Culture beyond the school. In support of this initiative, our Chinese Language Department organized a learning journey for our P5 Chinese Language students to watch a Chinese drama performance **‘Bao Xiao Long Zhua Zei Ji (包小龙抓贼记)** by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Arts and Cultural Troupe on 31 March 2023. The cast of the performance engaged the audience with their animated and humorous performance. The actors from the drama interacted with the audience to get their opinions on the identity of the thief in the show! After the up-close interaction with the characters, our students left the performance armed with some new Chinese idioms like _‘水落石出’、’丢三落四’、’路不拾遗’_ _and_ _‘物归原主’._ All students then completed a post-performance activity ‘四页书’ which requires them to create a mini comic comprising of four pages, capturing what they have learnt. This activity was aligned to our school MTL department’s aim of “Learning the Language, Living the Culture”.

#### **Hari Raya Celebration**
Our school’s Hari Raya Concert was lined up with a series of performances. The two emcees engaged the audience through their interaction and sharing of their experiences of Hari Raya Eve on stage.

The Malay Dance CCA group comprising students from Primary 3 to 6 kickstarted the concert with a dance performance titled, ‘Lip Lap Raya’. The highlight of the concert went to the exuberant Fashion Show put up by groups of students, teachers as well as our Vice Principals. They paraded down the hall donned in a variety of eye-catching Malay traditional costumes. Next, a beautifully choreographed dance was performed by a multi-racial group of teachers. The audience sang along to the song, ‘Raya Raya Raya’ as they watched the teachers performed with great enthusiasm.

A short quiz segment and the screening of the Hari Raya well-wishes video clip were followed. Our Principal made a special appearance in the video, sharing his well-wishes with everyone. The concert ended on a high note with a sing and dance item performed by our Primary 1 students.

#### **P5 Mathematics Olympiad Training**
<br>
For students who demonstrated aptitude and interest in Mathematics, our school organises Olympiad training workshops to equip these students with concepts and skills that are beyond the confines of the syllabus. This year, 35 of our Primary 5 students participated in the Mathematics Olympiad training. Throughout the enriching 8 sessions, our students had the opportunity to engage in intriguing discussion of advanced Mathematical concepts, which in turn hone their problem-solving skills. The students also had fun articulating their solutions and ideas to solve the challenging problems posed to them.

#### **P3 Conversation Chinese and Malay (CCM)**
<br>
The Primary 3 students participated in a one-day Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme Beginners Module on 23 May 2023. The purpose of CCM is to strengthen bonds among students of different races; at the same time helping them acquire the languages that would enable them to operate comfortably in the region. Our students were engaged in their learning through various activities such as conversation while marketing in supermarket, group works, games, sing-along, dialogues and role-playing. They were also taught to engage in simple daily conversations, such as the different practices in greeting the elderly and their peers through the different intonation and gestures.
