#### **MTL Fortnight 2023**

Our school’s Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department organised our annual MTL Fortnight 2023 from 4 July to 14 July. MTL Fortnight aims to create an environment that encourages students to use and appreciate the heritage and culture associated with our three official Mother Tongue languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). During the MTL Fortnight, our students experienced specially curated thematic enrichment programmes conducted by vendors and our own MTL teachers. They had a chance to explore and experience MTL-related cultural activities such as clay modelling, making rod puppet, Malay customs and Martial Arts and hands-on experience of feeling and smelling different herbs and spices. It was an enriching week for our students to learn more about the cultural traditions unique to each Mother Tongue language and developed interest in their Mother Tongue languages. This programme is line aligned with our school MTL department’s aim of “Learning the Language, Living the Culture”.

To create an immersive environment for the learning and appreciation of the cultures of our Mother Tongue Languages, our school’s Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department organised a Cultural Camp for our P4 MTL students on 19 July. During the P4 MTL Cultural Camp, our students had a chance to explore and experience different MTL language-related cultural activities. It provided opportunities for students to experience the different MTL cultures in an authentic setting. Students gained a deeper understanding of their culture and heritage through a Chinese Language exhibition titled ‘A Journey to The West’, hands-on activities such as Warli Art painting and a learning journey to Kampong Lorong Buangkok.

#### **Team Drumming**
Team drumming is part of school support for students with special educational needs. The objectives of this programme are 1) to bolster the attention and focus spans of our students; 2) to strengthen social skills and 3) to build confidence. Sessions are led by an MOE-approved drum instructor. 

Team Drumming complements the current school curriculum and extends learning beyond the classroom. The drummers have great fun learning to listen to one another and to play in harmony.
