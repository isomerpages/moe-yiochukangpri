#### **Tamil Literacy Competition 2023**

The Tamil Language Department held our annual school based Tamil Literacy Competition 2023 on 7 July. There were 30 finalists from the Primary 1 to Primary 6 cohorts who were passionate in showcasing their flair for the Tamil language. The audience, comprising of P5 and P6 Tamil language students and teachers, were enthusiastic in their support. We were also grateful for the many parent-volunteers who were present to encourage our school’s effort to promote the Tamil language. The Tamil Literacy Competition was aligned to our school MTL department’s aim of “Learning the Language, Living the Culture".
