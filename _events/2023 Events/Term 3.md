#### **MTL Fortnight 2023**

Our school’s Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department organised our annual MTL Fortnight 2023 from 4 July to 14 July. MTL Fortnight aims to create an environment that encourages students to use and appreciate the heritage and culture associated with our three official Mother Tongue languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). During the MTL Fortnight, our students experienced specially curated thematic enrichment programmes conducted by vendors and our own MTL teachers. They had a chance to explore and experience MTL-related cultural activities such as clay modelling, making rod puppet, Malay customs and Martial Arts and hands-on experience of feeling and smelling different herbs and spices. It was an enriching week for our students to learn more about the cultural traditions unique to each Mother Tongue language and developed interest in their Mother Tongue languages. This programme is line aligned with our school MTL department’s aim of “Learning the Language, Living the Culture”.

#### **Tamil Literacy Competition 2023**

The Tamil Language Department held our annual school based Tamil Literacy Competition 2023 on 7 July. There were 30 finalists from the Primary 1 to Primary 6 cohorts who were passionate in showcasing their flair for the Tamil language. The audience, comprising of P5 and P6 Tamil language students and teachers, were enthusiastic in their support. We were also grateful for the many parent-volunteers who were present to encourage our school’s effort to promote the Tamil language. The Tamil Literacy Competition was aligned to our school MTL department’s aim of “Learning the Language, Living the Culture".

#### **P4 Cultural Camp**

To create an immersive environment for the learning and appreciation of the cultures of our Mother Tongue Languages, our school’s Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department organised a Cultural Camp for our P4 MTL students on 19 July. During the P4 MTL Cultural Camp, our students had a chance to explore and experience different MTL language-related cultural activities. It provided opportunities for students to experience the different MTL cultures in an authentic setting. Students gained a deeper understanding of their culture and heritage through a Chinese Language exhibition titled ‘A Journey to The West’, hands-on activities such as Warli Art painting and a learning journey to Kampong Lorong Buangkok.

#### **Science Competitions**

Selected Primary 4 and 5 students participated in the Investigative Science Competition – The 21st Elementz Science Project Competition. Through investigative-type projects and by providing a platform for schools to share their findings, the competition aims to promote science research and develop students’ scientific research skills.

Some Primary 3 and 4 student-representatives participated in the Singapore Science Buskers competition where they presented science concepts in fun and engaging ways. This helps to strengthen students’ scientific knowledge and concepts as well as build effective communication skills.

#### **E2K Science Enrichment Programme**

During the E2K Science Enrichment sessions, selected P4 and P5 students had the opportunity to inquire and apply scientific knowledge, concepts, skills and attitudes in authentic settings through science investigative activities. They learnt how to design and carry out experiments to investigate real-world phenomena and evaluate the validity and reliability of their findings.

#### **Team Drumming**
Team drumming is part of school support for students with special educational needs. The objectives of this programme are 1) to bolster the attention and focus spans of our students; 2) to strengthen social skills and 3) to build confidence. Sessions are led by an MOE-approved drum instructor. 

Team Drumming complements the current school curriculum and extends learning beyond the classroom. The drummers have great fun learning to listen to one another and to play in harmony.

#### **Racial Harmony Day**
Our school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 21 July 2023. School staff and students came dressed in a variety of vibrant ethnic costumes to commemorate this important day which reminds all Singaporeans about the importance of racial harmony and social cohesion. This year's theme, ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’, underlines the appreciation of Singapore’s cultural and religious diversity and how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to weave a unique cultural tapestry that characterises Singaporean life.

#### **Change In Action**
Change in Action is a semester-long programme organised annually for the Primary 5 prefects.

It aims to empower our student leaders to be critical thinkers and problem solvers who initiate a change for improvement in school. Using Design Thinking, our students gathered to brainstorm possible ways to tackle problems identified in school. Since March 2023, they have been industriously planning and executing their various projects.

When it unexpectedly rains, students who do not have an umbrella end up getting caught in the rain as they make their way home.
<br>
<br>
With donations gathered from their teachers and schoolmates, the prefects set up a self-run umbrella station in school, where students may loan an umbrella for a day if needed.
<br>
<br>
To promote this new initiative, the students gave a presentation to the school during the school assembly. Posters were also put up near the school gates. With this initiative, students no longer have to worry about getting caught in the rain.</span></p></td></tr><tr style="mso-yfti-irow:2"><td width="40" valign="top" style="width:30.0pt;border:solid black 1.0pt;
