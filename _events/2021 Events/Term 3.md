**Racial Harmony Day**

Annually, on the 21 July, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) to mark the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots – a reminder not to take racial harmony for granted. The  theme for this year is “Common Spaces, Connected Communities.” We want to help our students to explore what it means to strengthen connection amongst communities, and to take action Annually, on the 21 July, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) to mark the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots – a reminder not to take racial harmony for granted. This  theme for this year is “Common Spaces, Connected Communities.” We want to help our students to explore what it means to strengthen connection amongst communities, and to take action to preserve racial harmony in Singapore.    
  
As an activity leading up to RHD, the NE Team collaborated with the Art Department to arranged for students of different ethnicity to come together and design a special Merlion during their Art lesson. This provided an additional opportunity for students of different races to work together and build friendship. Under the guidance of the Art teachers, the students collaborated well and produced many beautiful artwork.    
  
On Racial Harmony Day, students and staff supported the event enthusiastically by putting on their ethnic best. An enriching assembly programme put up by the NE team reminded our students the importance of working hard to preserve racial harmony. The assembly ended on a high note, with a CIMO dance at the lower primary students which incorporated the different ethnic elements and an exciting Kahoot quiz for the upper primary students. At the end, we reminded our students that racial harmony takes more than just wearing ethnic costumes and doing a dance together. To preserve racial harmony in Singapore, we must continue to seek to understand and appreciate the different communities in Singapore so that we can stronger together.
