**YCKPS Olympic Gala 2021**

During Assembly on 25 October 2021, values seen in the Olympics that were in line with our school values were shared. Students were also excited to find out who are the winners in each event they took part in the YOG 2021. FTs presented the medals to the winners in their respective classes. The programme gave students the chance to experience a whole-school sports event amidst the current situation and also valuable lessons on the school values of Excellence and Resilience. 

To foster cohesiveness within the classes at a lower primary setting, P1-P3 students were involved in class challenges where they would attempt to score points for their classes. The activities consisted of various elements of locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills that had been taught to students under the unit of Fundamental Movement Skills. Top four classes with the highest number of points in a series of five challenges received medals for their efforts. 

In line with the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020, upper primary students experienced individualised athletics events during their PE lessons. The five events catered to various skillsets such as a middle-distance run, sprint, jumps (for distance and height) and throws. Students not only immersed themselves in the atmosphere of the Olympics, they also had the opportunity to showcase their talents in athletics. Top five male and female students of the level for each event received medals for their valiant effort.

**Singapore Youth Science Fair 2021  
  
**

This year, three Primary 5 teams participated in the Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF). The SYSF is designed to promote Science education and provide the platform for young students at the Primary and Lower Secondary levels to showcase their innovative scientific investigations. From this experience, our students gained valuable knowledge, skills and attitudes in scientific inquiry and communication. Our teams did us proud by clinching two Distinction awards and one Accomplishment award! As a result of this remarkable achievement, YCKPS was accorded the Most Outstanding Participation (Primary) Award! 

**Project Title: Comparison of Alternative Forms of Plastic with Petroleum-Based Plastic** 

The team researched that replacing the harmful petroleum-based plastics with bioplastics may be a step towards protecting our environment. They made plastics from plant and animal products and compared the strength, solubility, heat resistance and biodegradability of the bioplastics with petroleum-based plastics. The team concluded that there is a possibility to produce plastics from plant products and animal products for daily use if a method could be devised to strengthen the bioplastics, make them insoluble and of higher heat resistance, without losing the property of biodegradability.

**Project Title: The Effect of Music on Human Reaction Time** 

The students investigated the effect of four types of music – calm classical, intense classical, folk and metal – on human reaction time. They found out that music helps to improve human reaction time and that folk music is the most effective, with calm classical being the least effective.

**Project Title: The Effect of Acid on Seed Germination**

The team of students investigated the effect of acid on the germination of seeds. The students did two investigations. The first investigation showed that when there was too much harmful gases polluting the air, none of the seeds would germinate. The percentage of acid was lowered in the second investigation. From that, the team concluded that the higher the percentage of acid, the fewer the number of seeds germinated.
