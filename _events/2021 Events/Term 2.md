**P2 to P4 Nurture Programme**

Selected P2 to P4 students started their Nurture Programme in the afternoon of 26 March 2021. The Nurture Programme is conducted weekly in partnership with Central Singapore CDC. The programme is for children who needed a bit more learning support and its outcomes are:

•        Build confidence as communicators

•        Develop as effective problem solvers and

•        Become motivated and self-directed learners

The lessons are designed to be activity-based. In the first lesson, the students set Nurture class rules aligned to our school values. They also created emotion plates and shared their feelings. The students had a fruitful and engaging session. They are looking forward to their weekly sessions with their lead teachers and SMU volunteers.

**Mother Tongue Fortnight (Tamil Language)**

The Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight is a platform for students to engage in exploring new knowledge and deeper learning in a fun and engaging manner that ignites and enhances their experiences in Tamil Language (TL) and its cultural activities. This year’s TL theme is \`Indian Traditional and Folk Dance Forms\`  and we got the students engaged in exploring traditional and folk dance forms through rich sharing of the various key traditional dance forms and its nuances. They had their knowledge put to test through fun kahoot quiz games, colouring activities and hands on experience in learning simple folk dance moves, namely, Kollattam and Oyillattam.          

P1 and P2 students engaged in their colouring activity.

**Integration Programme**

On 9 April, international students from Primary 1 to Primary 5, together with their local buddies, attended the _Integration Programme_ to know more about Singapore_._ The session started off with the students playing an ice-breaking game to know each other better. After the ice-breaking game, they participated in a series of popular traditional game, consisting of _Chapteh_, _Goli (glass marbles)_, _Five stones_, _Kuti Kuti_ and _Tok Kah (one-legged catching)._ These games gave these international students, who had only came to Singapore in the recent years, a platform to build an emotional connection and friendship with their local buddies. At the same time, it also provided our Singaporean students the opportunity to play host and interact with their buddies.
