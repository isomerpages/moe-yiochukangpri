#### **P2 to P4 Nurture Programme**

Selected P2 to P4 students started their Nurture Programme in the afternoon of 26 March 2021. The Nurture Programme is conducted weekly in partnership with Central Singapore CDC. The programme is for children who needed a bit more learning support and its outcomes are:

•        Build confidence as communicators

•        Develop as effective problem solvers and

•        Become motivated and self-directed learners

The lessons are designed to be activity-based. In the first lesson, the students set Nurture class rules aligned to our school values. They also created emotion plates and shared their feelings. The students had a fruitful and engaging session. They are looking forward to their weekly sessions with their lead teachers and SMU volunteers.

#### **Mother Tongue Fortnight (Tamil Language)**

The Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight is a platform for students to engage in exploring new knowledge and deeper learning in a fun and engaging manner that ignites and enhances their experiences in Tamil Language (TL) and its cultural activities. This year’s TL theme is \`Indian Traditional and Folk Dance Forms\`  and we got the students engaged in exploring traditional and folk dance forms through rich sharing of the various key traditional dance forms and its nuances. They had their knowledge put to test through fun kahoot quiz games, colouring activities and hands on experience in learning simple folk dance moves, namely, Kollattam and Oyillattam.
