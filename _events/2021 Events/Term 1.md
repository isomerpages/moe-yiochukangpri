**P1 Orientation (4 January 2021)**  
  

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the first day of school in 2021 (4 January 2021) became a day where we welcomed our Primary 1 students and parents (in 2 batches).

  

After being welcomed in the morning, the P1 students were brought to their respective classrooms by their Form Teachers. They went through a series of activities to learn more about life in a primary school.  The students also took a tour of their new school campus.

The parents were brought to another set of classrooms for an online presentation about the school and its programmes. They went for a school tour and watched their child taking part in their first recess in a primary school.

The parents also took part in a simple makerspace activity where they made a simple craft for their child.  It was a packed day of activities for both the students and parents alike.

**First day of school and SIR**

On the second day of Term 1, we welcomed back the rest of the school population for the new school year. The students went through 3 days of Start It Right (SIR) programme to prepare them for the academic year. Here are some photos of our students returning back to school.

**P3-P6 Student Leadership Training**  

On 5 February 2021, the school started  its first student training of the year for our P3 to P6 student leaders - Prefects, Class Monitors, Eco Monitors and Cyber Wellness Monitors. In our effort to nurture confident students with a heart to serve, the school provides opportunities for students to take on leadership roles within the classrooms as well as the larger school community. The unique situation caused by COVID-19 led to the first group of Student Leaders  ‘coming together’ remotely via Zoom. This was followed by a training session held by the respective departments for their student leaders.

**Safer Internet Day 2021**

Across the globe, we celebrated the 18th edition of Safer Internet Day on 9 Feb 2021. The theme this year is “_Together for a Better Internet_”. Everyone has a role to play in creating and maintaining a better online world. To mark this day, the school engaged TOUCH Cyberwellness on 10 Feb to share via Zoom about _Gaming Disorder – From Attraction to Addiction_ during the FTGP period to educate our students about the dangers of online gaming.

**Chinese New Year Celebrations 2021**  

Chinese New Year was celebrated this year with various interesting classroom activities, where students enjoyed learning more about the Nian Monster, Yu Sheng and the rationale for eating some festive food during Chinese New Year.

Many teachers and students were dressed in red or their traditional costume for this special occasion.

This Chinese New Year celebration was unique as it was conducted entirely online. Many wonderful and eye-opening performances were put up that day, like the drum and skit performance by our students, in which students learn more about the Chinese New Year customs. Our Music teachers also prepared a body percussion session, where teachers and students got up and moved their body rhythmically to the festive songs. Even though parents were not able to join us this year in our concert this year, they prepared a video to wish all staff and students a great year ahead. Class monitors gave out oranges to their form teachers, and wished their form teachers using some of the new greetings that they had just learnt. The concert ended off with classroom decoration results announcement, where the two best decorated classrooms at each level were presented with a certificate by school leaders.

**Crime Advisory Talk by Singapore Police Force**

During the assembly programme on 1 March, the school engaged officers from the _Singapore Police Force (SPF)_ to share via ZOOM on Crime Advisory.  This is a yearly engagement session that the school has in partnership with the _Hougang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC)_. In the past, the community police officers would came down to the school hall  to conduct a face-to-face assembly programme for our students. The session this year resumed online with one of the officers who _spoke_ to our students on crime prevention  and cyber awareness. The students were also taught how to help the police when reporting crime.

**P5 ESTEM Project Work (EPW) and Learning Journey**

The **_P5 EPW_** and a learning journey trip to the NEWater Visitor Centre were organised for the P5 students in Term 1 Week 10. EPW is part of the school’s **_Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Environmental Science - ESTEM@YCKPS,_** which stands for ‘**E**nvironmental **STEM**\-based applied learning **at** **Y**io **C**hu **K**ang **P**rimary **S**chool’. Through the EPW, our students learn to cooperate and share in teams to analyse a problem faced by Singapore. This project raises their awareness about water conservation in our resource-scarce nation and the challenges we face as a small country.

Our P5 students also learnt Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) skills such as identifying keywords to improve online search results and learning to use Microsoft Excel to create simple graphs. They used thinking tools for reflection and our English Department’s S.T.A.G.E. framework to present their projects.

**Personal Device for Learning Programme (PDLP) Pilot**  

We are one of the five primary schools identified by MOE to be on the **_Personal Device for Learning Programme (PDLP) Pilot for Primary Schools_** this year. The **_Primary 4 Tamil, Mathematics and Science teachers_** will be going through 3 Design Cycles throughout this year where they will come together to learn and design **_technology enabled lessons_** with MOE HQ personnel for our students. They will learn how technology can fit into the curriculum and how it can be used meaningfully to enrich our students’ learning. They would also have their classrooms opened for observation and support MOE’s research in this area. Here are some photos of the Mathematics and Science lessons in progress.

**Prize Giving Ceremony 2020**

On Friday 5 March 2021, 31 graduands from the 2020 Primary 6 batch were invited back to their alma mater to attend the annual Prize Giving Ceremony. These ex-P6 students clinched the top academic prizes for class, level and the PSLE. Some of them were also recognized for having outstanding character traits of excellence, resilience and service. They were awarded the prestigious **_School Advisory Committee (SAC) Student Recognition Awards_**; namely the **_Student of the Year Award_**, **_Youth of Character (Resilience) Award_** and **_Keen to Serve Award_**.

Due to the Covid-19 situation, the event was only limited to invited guests of the SAC and representatives from the Parent Support Group (PSG). Our SAC Chairman, Mr Thomas Choong, graced the occasion as the Guest-of-Honour.  All attendees had to adhere to the Safe Management Measures (SMM) for the entire duration of the ceremony. After the ceremony, in the absence of parents and loved ones, the award winners took photos with the SAC and PSG members.
