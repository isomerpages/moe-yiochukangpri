#### **2018 Challenge-based Learning (CBL) Workshop ‘Global Sustainable Growth: Waste Not Our Future’ \[16th to 18th July 2018\]**  

Our Primary Five Higher Chinese Language students participated in a two and a half-day international learning workshop organised by Canberra Primary School and supported by Apple, SINGAPORE. Together with students from Suzhou JinChang Experimental Primary School&nbsp;(苏州市金阊实验小学校), a total of 100 students engaged in an array of learning activities revolving the theme: ‘Global Sustainable Growth: Waste Not Our Future’. Apple’s Challenge Based Learning (CBL) was adopted as an approach for active learning with a real-world context.

Learning takes place beyond the classrooms as students engaged in cross-cultural understanding, negotiations during collaboration and interactive learning journeys. Students also have opportunities to explore different learning applications using iPads to consolidate their learning.
