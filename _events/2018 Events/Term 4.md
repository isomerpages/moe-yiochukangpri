#### **2018 Children’s Day concert**  
  
The theme for the 2018 Children’s Day concert was “Super Heroes”. School leaders, teachers, parents from the Parents Support Group (PSG) and even our very own Sports Programme Executive (SPE) Mr Sean Wong, put up scintillating, sporting and entertaining performances that brought to the fore, the message of optimism, resilience and gratitude to our children in YCKPS. 

A Super Hero, is resilient, who never gives up and tries his/her best to overcome trials and tribulations. In life, when everything seems all doom and gloom, a Super Hero would come to our rescue. At the end of the&nbsp;day, we are eternally grateful to the Super Hero who saves our&nbsp;day.

In the&nbsp;eyes of the children, these Super Heroes exist in our everyday life. He/She may be a friend, parent, family member or relative, teacher, school staff or even a stranger. Hence, Super Heroes act as&nbsp;children's role models to show them the will, courage and resolve to emulate the many outstanding values and qualities of a Super Hero - Defender of the weak, upholding justice and righteousness and the moral courage to put the wrong things right. Finally,&nbsp;children,&nbsp;representing the future of the human race, need empathy and respect to demonstrate gratitude towards the Super Heroes who have helped them along in life’s journey and pay it forward.

Indeed this year’s annual&nbsp;Children's&nbsp;Day&nbsp;concert marks yet another fun, exciting and memorable occasion that truly exemplifies the spirit of the YCKPS family and commemorates the celebratory joys of being a child.
