#### **Commemoration of International Friendship Day 2018**  

_Celebrating the ASEAN Community_&nbsp;is the theme for this year’s International Friendship Day (IFD). Through our assembly programme, recess interactive activities and class-based CCE lessons, we hope to inspire our pupils to play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, reinforcing our sense of togetherness and strengthening our ASEAN identity.

The P5 students attended a 3D2N Residential Camp at the Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (DFOALC) from 9 – 11 April 2018. The Camp provided a rich learning experience outside the classroom setting where students were given opportunities to develop holistically and build up their resilience and ruggedness. Students went through various activities such as challenging oneself in the Challenge Rope Course (CRC), hikes and buddy night walk. They were able to strengthen their camaraderie by working and overcoming obstacles together.

These students wanted to learn how to converse better with their friends of other races, hence they joined the CCM programme and learn another language. Other than learning how to converse in another language, they've learnt more about the culture as well.
