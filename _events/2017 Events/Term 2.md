#### **Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp**  

Every year, our Primary 5 pupils will get the opportunity to attend a 3 Days 2 Night Adventure Camp outside of school.

This year, the adventure camp was held at MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure and Learning Centre, from 27th March to 29th March 2017.

The objectives of the camp was to provide students with opportunities to further develop resilience, independence and co-operation, as well as instill leadership qualities in students.

Many of the teachers who attended the camp with the P5 students felt that this year's camp was much more meaningful. This was because the values of resilience and showing appreciation and care towards others was emphasized throughout the camp.

May the pictures below show you the amount of learning and fun our P5 students experienced during their camp!

#### **Values in Action (ViA) Exposition and Kindness Week**

We held a week long exposition for our students to showcase their projects, as well as spread important messages to educate their school mates on how one can do their part to make social change in their lives.
