#### **Overseas Immersion Programme to Shanghai**  

Every year, 20-25 of our P4 and P5 students, taking Chinese Language, will get the opportunity to go to Shanghai No.1 Primary School for an enriching immersion programme!

This year, during the first week of the June Holidays, our students and teachers had a great learning experience there. Check out the pictures [here](https://yiochukangpri.moe.edu.sg/departments/character-n-citizenship-education-cce/internalisation-programme) ~

#### **Junior Entrepreneurs' Programme**  

Our schools's student care centre - YMCA arranged an Entrepreneurs' Programme! The children specially crafted a handmade photo-frame and stationery holder. They used their public speaking skills and enthusiasm to sell what they made at the Sengkang South Little Entrepreneurs & Family Carnival.

#### **Mother Tongue Fortnight: Chinese Language Digital Book Trail**  

The Chinese Language department created a Chinese Language Book Trail based on 3 great Chinese Masterpieces. Teachers shared with students on few segments of the stories in Pilgrimage to the West; Journey to the West, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Heroes of the Marshes; Water Margins respectively. Students then went on a book trail to learn more about the characters and content of the book.
