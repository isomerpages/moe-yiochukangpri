#### **Chinese New Year Celebration 2017**  
  
Our annual Chinese New Year Celebration was once again organized successfully! The students watched the performance put up by our Chinese Dance in awe; had fun during the games section; they felt proud of their own classroom when it won as the Best Decorated Classroom for CNY; last but not least, the Lion Dance performance was the finale which livened up the entire atmosphere!

This year, the Classroom Decoration Competition was done differently. Each classroom was decorated based on the theme: CNY Customs and Traditions. The Judges followed the following **_Judging Criteria:_**

**_Relevance to theme, Festivity, Learning Value_**

Through this competition, we hope that our students gain more knowledge about the Chinese culture and the traditions and practices, through the fun and bonding process of decorating the classroom.

Our students used their creative juices and put up many interesting decorations in their classrooms!

#### **Prefects' Investiture**  
  

The Prefects’ Investiture today is an important milestone for all prefects in Yio Chu Kang Primary School. It is in this ceremony that the prefects officially receive their badges and take their prefect pledge. During the investiture ceremony which is led by the disicipline committee teachers, the school is informed on the roles and responsibilities of the prefects and councillors, as well as the head and vice head prefect and their training focus areas. 

The selection process for the head and vice head prefect, councillors and prefects was made known to the school. The prefects and councillors were led into the hall, by the 2017 Head Prefect, Keagen Teo and Vice Head Prefect, Althea Ng. After the ceremony the prefects recited the prefects pledge which shows their commitment to serve in their roles with pride, respect and honour.

#### **P4, P5, P6 Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)**  
  
Focusing on the **acquisition of values** and **creating awareness on global issues** amongst students, the school’s Interdisciplinary Project Work takes on a more robust and dynamic approach this year. The students explored issues such as **World Hunger** and the importance of **healthy eating** at Primary 4 level, **Singapore’s perenial water issue** at Primary 5 level and **Man’s impact on the environment** at Primary 6 level.

The aim is to develop students into good and useful citizens in a fast changing and globalised world. It develops students through an understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, inspiring them to show concern about the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. (MOE CCE)

Character Education is infused into IPW through Values in Action (VIA) programme. This programme engages our P4, P5 and P6 students in a dynamic problem-solving process with the aim of encouraging them to make a difference to the community. The programme is closely aligned with the school’s core values.
