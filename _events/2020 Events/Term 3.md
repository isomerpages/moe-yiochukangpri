Every year, schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21 Jul 2020. This year, we commemorated the event on 13 Jul 2020 as the actual day falls on the unprecedented Term 3 mid-term school break. Nonetheless, the Covid-19 pandemic did not dampen our spirit to commemorate the event. Students and staff supported the event by cladding in colorful ethnic costumes. Besides the usual Assembly Talk, an array of interesting traditional cultural activities were lined up for the students to bring out  the RHD theme - “Multicultural Singapore”.  During PE lessons and CCE lessons, students played traditional games such as Sepak Takraw, Zero-point, Pallanguli and Chapteh with their friends. During recess, they also tried various types of traditional food of different races specially prepared by our canteen vendors.

**2020 National Day @ Yio Chu Kang Primary School**

Our school commemorated National Day on 7 Aug 2020, Friday.

Due to the Covid19 pandemic, this year’s National Day programme was quite different from the previous years. Leading on to the national event, pre-assembly programmes filled with songs and activities started from 3 Aug 2020 and went on for a week to hype up the celebration mood. On the day of the commemoration, the Observance Ceremony was livestreamed from the parade square while all staff and students participated in the ceremony from the classrooms.

Even in the midst of the pandemic, students and staff clad in red tops formed a sea of red in every classroom. Many students also brought along their own handheld national flags for the celebration.  All these represents the resolve and commitment of everyone in the school to be part of the national collective effort to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic.
