#### **Start It Right (SIR) - Primary 5**  

With students coming from different classes, “Start in Right” helped to ease the anxiety of a new school term for the P5 students. It also created a platform for Form Teachers to get to know their students in a non-teaching setting. Students went through different lesson activities aiming to equip them with the essential knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to prepare for the new school term. One of the key highlights of the programme would be the Class Interaction Games. It created the opportunity for students to overcome shyness and to forge new friendships. Through the games, students are able to demonstrate care and concern for their classmates, cheering them on while they were playing against another team and displaying the never give up attitude even when the team is down.

#### **Class Leaders' Training on 13 January 2020**  

In line with the school’s vision and motto, to nurture each student into a Youth of Character, Keen to Serve, the Student Leadership Committee organised a Class Leaders’ Training session for nominated class leaders. The training session, which was conducted on January 13 was a platform for selected students from every class to learn the skills required to take on their assigned leadership roles.

  

Class leaders attended a mass briefing conducted by Mdm Huda. The briefing touched on the overarching leadership model of SERVE - an acronym for Support school programmes, Engage others, Role-model the school values, Value others and Enrich the lives of others. They also learnt about the key traits of a good and effective leader through interesting videos.

  

Each group of class leaders, were then briefed on the specific requirements pertaining to their roles by the respective teachers in charge of these leaders, both from the Student leadership team as well as the IP departments.

  

The teachers who conducted the training were as follows:

  

| Class Leadership Role | Teacher(s) in charge |
| --- | --- |
| P3 – P4 Class Monitor | Miss Mary Chia |
| P5 – P6 Class Monitor | Miss Leong Baoru |
| English Monitor/Reading Activist | Mdm Huda &amp; Mrs Jasmine Chan |
| Math Champion | Mdm Chen Lifen and Mrs Melissa Tan |
| Aesthetics Monitor | Mdm Sharon Lim |
| Ecopal | Mr Jaya &amp; Mdm Sudriyanti |
| Cyber Wellness Monitor | Mdm Kaiyisah |
| PE Monitors | Mr Kenneth Seah and Miss Syahidah |

  

Using MTV routines, the teacher trainers, included interesting activities in their sessions, ranging from real case scenarios, teacher demonstrations, collaborative learning to role play. It was clear that while the respective class leaders were engaged by their teacher trainers, the sessions provided them with an opportunity to clarify on their key responsibilities and roles. Based on the Student Leadership framework of ISTEER (Identification, Selection, Training, Empowerment, Evaluation and Recognition), the team will embark on a new initiative to provide all class leaders with collar pins so that they can be easily identified and to give them a sense of esteem and pride in executing their respective roles.


Moving forward, the Student Leadership Team will continue looking into ways to hone the leadership skills of these group of class leaders. through a mid-point check in Term 2, to see how well they are coping with their key roles and the type of training that they would require to continue their good work.

#### **TOTAL DEFENCE DAY 2020**

This year, our school marked Total Defence Day on 14 February 2020 amidst the backdrop of the Covid-19 situation.

The days leading up to Total Defence Day saw everyone rallying together like well-oiled machinery as the school’s emergency preparedness plan was activated in real time.&nbsp; The school’s constant emphasis on key phrases like ‘personal hygiene’, ‘social distancing’, and ‘looking out for one another regardless of race, religion or self-interests’ were well-received by the students. They took pride in carrying out their civic duties.

On 14 February, the Six Pillars of Defence, highlighting the importance of Social, Psychological and Digital Defence in combating the current Covid-19 situation, as well as the meaning of the various SCDF emergency sirens, were shared with the students. As part of the activities to commemorate Total Defence Day, our students learnt the importance of practising good hygiene during recess through the introduction of the wipe-down routine in the canteen. During snack break for the day, every student was given a packet of cream cracker to remind them of Singapore’s not-too-distant past when our forefathers had to depend on food rations to survive troubled times.

The critical message conveyed at Total Defence Day 2020 for all is to cherish what we have every day and put in every effort to keep Singapore safe!
